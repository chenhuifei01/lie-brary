[Make it stop](https://i.redd.it/afr39v7i6tia1.gif)

Re-takers LET'S GET OURSELVES TOGETHER. WE ARE WALKING IN THERE [ON THIS TYPE OF TIME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqtJw67xM14)

We've got to do this one fast because I'm typing this at a Starbucks outside my work and there is a crazy homeless (I think the proper term is ""unhoused"" now) woman who keeps walking up to me and shaking her fist at me and yelling demonic shit. I've tried to calm her down by buying her the $6 egg-bites but I don't know how much longer I can hold her off. #JustChicagoThings.

**Let's Discover the magic of Discovery**

https://i.redd.it/9o41ig5vhtia1.gif

Okay anything **proportional** or **relevant** is discoverable. But you can't dig too **DEEP**

**D**uplicative - you can't request things which you've already asked for or would be duplicative

**E**asier way - there can't be an easier way to get it.

**E**nough opportunity - you need to allow enough of an opportunity to get the information yourself first.

**P**rivilege - no privileged info INCLUDING WORK PRODUCT (material prepared for in preparation for litigation) unless it contains unprivileged and relevant facts that CANNOT be discovered without undue hardship.

**Note:** You can get electronic stored information so long as it's reasonably accessible (burden and cost analysis).

**Real-world analysis:** I worked at a personal injury firm and pretty much any discovery we asked for the other side would just choose violence and respond and say ""this request is unduly burdensome and duplicative"" and just shut us down unless we asked for like... the name of the hospital or some shit lmao. This was my face when I'd spend 47 hours cooking up discovery requests as a 1L for $13 an hour and then get an e-mail back that every request was ""unduly burdensome and duplicative"":

[Brutal being a law clerk](https://i.redd.it/pckcts059tia1.gif)

**What happens if you just tell the other side to fuck off when they ask for discovery?**

[No discovery for you Andrew and Tristan Tate](https://preview.redd.it/hvfe0lxu7tia1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=952b6b5937a524fa52ac701db0ecd18104a872df)

You will be in big trouble with the judge and he will sanction your ass. They have these ""discovery"" motion calls in a lot of courts where you have to go in front of a badass angry judge and he will go NUTS on you if you didn't do the depositions or submit the interrogatories or requests to produce on time. They can **strike your pleadings**, **make you pay money**, **dismiss your case if you acted in bad faith, treat certain issues as decided against you.**

**Special MEE Tip:** The NCBE loves this scenario of ""electronic discovery"" being lost or deleted in bad faith. I imagine they have some 79 year old person in their office whose granddaughter showed them snapchat and they lean back in their chair and say ""a modern lawyer must know about the perils of the internet."" Basically in the problem some sketchy manager from Walmart will delete a recording of a slip and fall and deprive everyone of it. If the loss was intentional... there will be an adverse inference which means the judge will actually TELL the jury ""you can assume this was bad for the side that deleted it."" lmao... if the judge tells the jury some ominous shit like that, you are definitely losing. Juries HATE to feel like someone tried to pull a sneak move on them or trick them (from my experience of working in the civil and criminal courts and talking to juries after, they always bring up how **they don't like** **witnesses trying to deceive them)**

**Safe-Harbor provision for Electronic Discovery:** If they can show the information was deleted in the ""ordinary"" practices of the data retention policy of the business, they will escape this adverse inference. 

**What kind of Discovery is there?**

Up top we can note that we **ALWAYS** have a duty to **supplement** or **amend** disclosures that are discovered to be inaccurate or not fully complete. All discovery tendered must be certified by the attorney that it is proper.

**MANDATORY DISCLOSURES & INITIAL DISCLOSURES**

Okay so the attorneys have to have this thing called a ""discovery conference."" There's a ton of shit they need to decide. In a personal injury case it could be like ""expert witness depositions"", ""treating physician depositions"", ""party depositions"", ""completion of requests to produce and interrogatories."" So they get all this shit together and submit a ""plan"" to the court, and often the court has to address issues which they are fighting about. If they don't stick with the plan, judge goes insane and yells at everyone, sanctions, you get the drill.

And you can't get **SLIC**k with the other side, you must give them up front:

**S**upporting documents used to support your claim (so long as they are discoverable)

**L**ikely witnesses (names and contact info and subject matter of testimony)

**I**nsurance - any agreement that would involve an insurance company (this is statutory... insurance companies have LIENS and medicare and all these people will fuck your whole life up if they paid for your medical care then you won a million bucks and didn't pay them back)

**C**omputation of damages - you need a computation of all of your damages and evidence supporting the calculation of damages.

**Expert Disclosures**: You need to disclose expert testimony **90** days before trial. **MBE Trick Alert:** If the expert disclosure is just being used to **REBUT** the other side's expert, it only has be disclosed **30 days** before trial. (Yes, they are really this petty to test us on this).

You need at LEAST an expert summary report but many courts require a complete written expert report with his opinion, the basis, exhibits, AND his **compensation** and **OTHER CASES THEY TESTIFIED ON.** (This is why personal injury lawyers will be like ""we can't use Johnny cardiologist, he's a SLUT. He has testified for plaintiff's 194 times in the last four years). The lawyers WILL ask the expert what they are making for their testimony and it always blows the juries mind apart. They will ask some top-tier machiavellian 14 time board certified-cardiologist xeno-millionaire professional expert witness cardiologist department head at Northwestern who is also a part-time member of the Bohemian Grove how much he's being paid to be there and testify for 6 hours and he'll be like ""$37,000"". The jury will just go completely quiet and stare silently at their $16 per day check from the county and their minds will be shattered by the harsh realities of this world.

**Pretrial Disclosures:** You must give detailed information about the evidence you plan on presenting at least **30 days** prior to trial. 

**Forms of Discovery:** Discovery comes in many forms including (1) depositions, (2) interrogatories, (3) requests to admit, (4) requests to produce, and (5) requests for physical or mental examinations. 

Let's talk **deps** 

[It was all Sunny Balwani's fault](https://i.redd.it/i73zdat46tia1.gif)

[She doesn't remember anything about the Edison](https://i.redd.it/n071ai186tia1.gif)

Deps are interviews with witnesses under oath before trial (written or oral). **One per witness, and ten total.** 7 hours max. Organizations are deposed through a **designated agent** who knows shit about what you want to talk about. 

**ROGS:** Written questions answered under oath. 25 allowed. 

**Requests to Admit**: Requesting the other side to admit facts and the authenticity of documents and shit about the law. You can make as many as you want before discovery closes. If they don't answer or object within 30 days, the requests are deemed admitted. Beware, if you fuck this up it will destroy your chance at winning the lawsuit (you'll end up admitting everything lol). 

**Requests to Produce:** Documents, electronic shit, tangible items. They need to be reasonable. 

**Requests for physical or mental examination:** only allowed if the court says so and a party's **""health"" must be in controversy** and you can't get it through other means. 

**Pretrial Orders:** Judge sets pretrial conferences to try and move the lawsuit along and foster settlement negotiations. He sets deadlines. Then releases a **FINAL PRETRIAL ORDER** to decide which evidence and issues the trial is allowed to be on. Uh oh... what if what you want to talk about is not in the final pretrial order? The court can amend that but **only to prevent manifest injustice**. Remember that for the MBE, they test on it. The MBE is just seeing if you can memorize all these stupid little key phrases and then pick them at the right time haha. **But as Grossman says, EACH QUESTION ONLY TESTS ON ONE THING. DO NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY THESE MBE QUESTIONS. OH THE QUESTION IS ABOUT FINAL PRETRIAL ORDERS? I WONDER WHAT THE ANSWER COULD BE....** 

THE ANSWER WILL SAY ""TO PREVENT MANIFEST INJUSTICE."" [They CANNOT TRICK US BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO USE THE MAGICAL WORDS IN THE ANSWER CHOICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l60MnDJklnM)

# The Motion of the Ocean 

Okay so motions generally have to be served 14 days before the hearing and they generally need an affidavit (sworn statement). Opposing affidavits need to be served 7 days before the hearing. 

Prior to answering the complaint you can just immediately hit them with a 12(b) motion to fuck the other sides whole life up. 

You can file a 12(b) for insufficient process or service, improper court (lack of SMJ, PJ or venue), or failure to state a claim meriting relief or failure to join a required party. 

**The MBE loves this failure to state a claim shit**. This one I always found kind of funny when I worked at the court. These pro se crackheads would come in and file 957 page motions against the city and then the city attorney would appear for 37 seconds and be like ""yea your honor I read this shit, there is not a single element of a prima facie case anywhere alleging anything even remotely cognizable."" Then the pro se person goes NUTS and give a legit SPEECH about sovereign citizenship for 147 minutes while the judge sits there totally stunned. 

[Then the judge says this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c)

You can put these in the answer instead of the 12(b) motion too. If you don't put them in either, you waive process for service issues and improper PJ and venue defenses. **You can never waive SMJ defenses, because the court always wants to know whether it can actually hear the case.** 

**Facial Attacks of Motion** 

You can also attack the face of the complaint. You can ask for **a more definite statement** (by asking specifically what additional details you desire) and the other side has 14 days to obey or the pleading will be STRUCK. 

You can move for a **judgment on the pleadings** after all the pleadings are closed too. This is kind of like a motion to dismiss. 

You can **move to strike** the offending parts of the motion before filing a response. **Real World Analysis:** I was so happy to help my boss on a motion to challenge the credibility of a confidential informant when I got my first job in private criminal defense a few years back and I worked so hard on it. My boss insisted that we could challenge the judge's private evaluation of the confidential informant she met with (she found him credible) and we tried to say basically that **the judge had bad judgment**. My 97 year old boss did not know you couldn't challenge the judge's credibility determination of a confidential source and the state just immediately moved to strike the whole pleading with one sentence only 30 minutes after I submitted it: ""This pleading is tantamount to an insinuation that the court and by extension the judge herself is not fit to determine the credibility of a confidential source whom she met with privately for over an hour. Move to strike."" ............... **I never recovered from that first motion.** 

[My face after reading it](https://i.redd.it/d2oc4w06jtia1.gif)

**The Legend of FRCP 56 and the Summary Judgment Motion** 

This one is kind of funny. You're basically like ""look... we are not actually in a fight. we don't even have a material dispute here to bring to a jury since you basically agree that I'm the shit."" 

Summary judgment can be brought when one or more material facts are not disputed or absent and the absent or undisputed facts entitle you to at least partial judgment as a matter of law. 

You can bring it before trial up until **30 days after discovery closes.** 

You need to **POINT TO THE RECORD** and affidavits based on personal knowledge. You're like ""HOMIE - LOOK AT THIS PATHETIC RECORD YOU SUBMITTED. SHOW ME SOME ACTUAL STUFF WHICH SAYS YOU ARE NOT AGREEING I AM RIGHT."" Then the non-moving party has to point to affidavits, depositions, documents, admissions, interrogatories and say ""go fuck yourself, there are genuine issues of material fact such that this SHOULD be put before a tribunal good sir."" Court then views it in the light most favorable to the NON-MOVANT. **MBE Trick:** Someone will give some bullshit affidavit based on the knowledge of their grandma or something. Affidavits need to be based on **PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.** 

**It's JMOL Time.** 

This is when you're like ""Judge... let's not even embarrass ourselves by giving this to the jury. This simple minded idiot who I'm up against didn't even present ANY evidence on one or more of the material elements... so a jury will just be in there watching Rick and Morty and have nothing to talk about. Please take it out of their hands and award me my trophy now and let's get home to watch Yellowstone."" You can bring this after the opposing party has presented all its evidence or before jury submission. This is an extraordinary remedy and the judge would literally be taking the case away from the jury, but it happens (even when small fuck ups happen like a states attorney doesn't ask the witness to identify the attacker in court... identity is needed and case gets JMAULED"" 

**Post-Trial Motions** 

Renewed JMOL and Motion for New Trial must be filed **28 days later** after entry of a judgment (remember the Zombie movie). 

**Renewed JMOL** is basically the same thing as **JMOL**... you're literally saying ""no reasonable jury could have reached this verdict, take it away from them after they've already rendered it."" **MBE Tip:** Guys... stop playing. If you don't file the first **JMOL**, you can't file a renewed **JMOL. THEY TEST ON THIS AND IT IS A FREE POINT.** 

**Motion for New Trial:** 

**Motions to Set Aside Judgment aka motion for relief:** Mistake, neglect, new evidence that couldn't have been discovered, and fraud must be brought in a reasonable time **not to exceed one year.** 

You can kinda remember these by thinking of this phrase  **""Me or you messed it up or crazy shit happened = 1 year""** 

Clerical errors, void, satisfied, or discharged judgment, or any other reason must be brought in a **reasonable time**. They actually test this... so remember the three which are one year max. 

# What Laws Should We Use? 

Okay normally if it's state court only involving state claims we are just using the laws of that state. In federal court with only federal claims, then obviously it's federal law that applies. 

but shit gets **fucking wild** in these federal diversity cases or **federal question cases with supplemental state law issues involved.** 

**WHAT IF THERE IS NO CONFLICT GOAT?** 

One time I was zooming in a finals study session with an ULTRA gunner (who always had to be right, he was ranked like second in our class) and I told him about this concept and he argued with me. Then he got so mad he signed off the zoom. All I said was that if there is a **federal law on point**, and that law does not conflict with a state law, you just apply the federal law on point. He thought I was trying to be narcy and was like ""what are you even talking about bro? ""federal law on point"" (he used bunny ears) what the fuck does that mean. you are trying to sound smart. it's always an Erie issue with diversity bro, it's always an Erie issue."" Then suddenly I was the only screen on the zoom. This actually happened.  

[Me explaining his meltdown later to my law school friends after 4 shots of tequila:](https://i.redd.it/oxak6cqgptia1.gif)

**Sorry Hayden**, it's not ""always an Erie issue""

**But what if it is an Erie issue?** 

If there's a conflict between federal and state laws, **Erie** just says you must apply federal procedural law and state substantive law. The whole purpose of Erie is uniformity - they want the result in Fed court to be the same as the result in state court. The whole difficult part about Erie is **determining which laws are procedural and which laws are substantive.** 

**First you gotta determine if it's procedural or substantive.** 

Procedural is like filing deadlines, court rules and procedures, discovery practices, rules of evidence. All the shit that helps the court run. The **processes and procedures of the court.** If it's procedural, federal law governs. 

Substantive is like the **legal rights & duties** involved in the case are affected. Elements of claim or defense, burdens of proof, statute of limitations, choice of law rules.  If it's substantive, state law governs. 

**If it's UNCLEAR, then it's a two-step process**

**Step 1: Is there a fed law on point?** If yes, use that. If no, move to step two. (they will tell you in the problem like an FRCP law is ""on point"" or something and then because of the supremacy clause we have to use that law over the state law)

**Step 2: If there isn't any federal law on point you have to look at the 3 approaches.** 

**Outcome determinative:** Apply state law if ignoring the state rule affects the outcome of the case. (sufficiency of minimum contacts, effect of res judicata, burden of proof, conflict choice of law rules)

**Balance of interests:** which court system has a stronger interest in having the issue resolved? heavier side wins on the scale. 

**Avoid forum shopping:** Federal court will apply state law if not following it will cause people to flood the fed courts and consciously forum shop. 

**But Goat, are there any things which are unclear that they like to test on?** 

Yes. Immunity, statute of frauds issues and PAROL, limits on damages, testimonial privileges. These are in kind of a gray area. 

# Jury Trials 

The 7th amendment gives you a federal right to a jury in most civil cases (except that one dumbass problem where a writ of ejectment in 1812 was not considered a cognizable claim based on Wonson or some shit lol). If the court is awarding legal relief aka $$$ DAMAGES, you are getting that jury. If it's just equitable relief... they are fine with you just bringing that in front of the judge. If there are both legal and equitable claims, legal claims must be tried first. Always just remember [to get the money FIRST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7NyNnwrm70)

You need a jury demand in your complaint or answer or you could file a demand within **14 days** of the last pleading that put the issue of damages on the table. Otherwise, it's waived. 

**Voire Dire ""to speak the truth"" -** This is the jury selection process. Weeding out people who could fuck up the fairness of the trial. Bias can be presumed in certain situations like employment relations or if they have stock in a company which is represented in the trial or if a family member or anyone they know is involved. **The judge or attorney just asks a shitload of questions to people about if they will be biased and most of them just answer to try and get out of the jury process lol. Then the judge yells at them.** 

You get unlimited strikes for cause. Three peremptory strikes without cause (sometimes more), so LONG as they are not based on **race or gender** (this is called a BATSON challenge when someone accuses you of this and you'll get in trouble with the licensing board if you are found to be doing this). 

Federal jury trial has six to twelve members. Must be at least 6 and unanimous verdict. 

**Jury Instructions** 

Jury instructions take place before jury deliberation, but additional instructions may be given at any time. Requests for jury instructions are written and filed and given to the other side. Before instructing the jury, the court hears the proposed instructions and allows them to object on the record (these instructions are often a basis for appeal so there is a lot of battle about them, I'm not really sure the jury is even listening when they are read though haha). 

To make a proper objection to the jury instructions you need to **TOSS** the football into the touchdown zone (yes I am a jock and watched the football game the other night) 

[Proof that I am into sports and watched it at this weird club. yes I am wearing lion socks ](https://preview.redd.it/iyh44qw5ztia1.jpg?width=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8ded3f47911b1e427020d16be6b7491f69787e52)

**T**imely - you must object when the court gathers to discuss the instructions. If you don't know about them later, you can object ""promptly upon finding out."" (MBE tests this)

**O**n the record 

**S**pecify what you're objecting to 

**S**pecify why you're objecting 

# Verdicts & Judgments 

**Default Judgment:** When the clerk or judge enters in a parties favor because the other party failed to defend. 

Clerk can enter default if she is going to **NASA** on Bezos' new private NASA trips. 

**N**ot minor or incompetent  
**A**bsent or failed to timely answer or appear   
**S**um certain (can be computed with certainty)  
**A**ffidavit - you requested with a damn affidavit. 

Otherwise judge enters if any of these NASA factors get fucked up. 

Default can be set aside if you show good cause for failure within a reasonable time, but NOT later than a year after default. Good cause is like **fraud, mistake, neglect.** 

**Dismissal**: Only the plaintiff can voluntarily dismiss a case. lol... the defendant can't voluntarily dismiss a case they didn't file. 

**Voluntary dismissal** is allowed when you file a notice of dismissal before the other side answers or motions for summary judgment or if you get a **stipulation** by all parties. You can only do this once for the same claim without prejudice. 

**A case can always be voluntarily dismissed with a court order without prejudice. If daddy judge says ANYTHING, then it shall be so.** 

Involuntary dismissal is if you fail to move the case along or don't obey court rules or you're just being a total shithead. 

**Jury Verdict** 

Two types: special and general. Both are written. 

**Special verdicts** make the jury decide on individual issues of FACT rather than the overall disposition of the case. they'll be like ""did you think Johnny had a gun? was Johnny a bad boy?"" 

**general verdicts** are general, they decide the overall case. 

**MBE ALERT:** They always test when the specific issues the jury decided don't make sense. The jury will decide like (1) Johnny is a bad boy, then (2) Johnny is a good boy, then (3) Johnny is innocent, and (4) Johnny killed everyone. Then the court is like wtf did these idiots just hand me. 

If this happens judge can (1) ask jury to reconsider, (2) order a new trial. If specific answers are consistent though (EVEN IF THE GENERAL OVERALL VERDICT IS INCONSISTENT WITH SPECIFIC) he can enter an order **consistent with the specific answers.** 

**Note:** When it's a bench trial the judge must state specific findings of fact on the record or in an opinion. **MBE Tip:** No... it does not always have to be written. He can just say that shit. Yes, you can challenge a judge's finding of fact with a motion for new trial. **Unfortunately for you, the person deciding it will be the judge himself lol.** 

**Claim Preclusion** 

Can you just keep suing someone on the same claim? No. **Same claim, same parties, and valid final judgment on the merits.** 123. Then you can only sue once you greedy bastard. 

But how will you remember this...?

Throw on your **VeST** and let's go out and dance the night away (Chiraq gang message me privately about this, we will be getting wasted at a specified date or time after this test). 

**V**alid, final judgment on the merits (case 1 must have ended this way obvi) 

**e** (I didn't have anything for this one)

**S**ame parties OR THEIR PRIVIES (privies are like people legally connected to them, don't forget this shit)

**T**ransactionally related claim - was or should have been raised in prior case. 

**Issue Preclusion** 

But Grossman is sad he didn't get to come to the party and dance the night away with us. He was with his vegan wife watching football (a sport I love). 

So he told us ""don't issue preclude me, I'm a **VIP** and I want to have **FUNN""**

(issue preclusion elements)

**V**alid final judgment on the merits  
**I**dentical issue litigated and actually NECESSARILY decided (not just some shit they dealt with in passing)  
**P**arty precluded was adequately represented as a party or privy 

When Grossman is NOT a party to the prior case (and using it offensively as a SWORD) it can't be unfair and has to be **FUNN** 

**F**oreseeable future suits (future lawsuits about the issue were foreseeable)  
**U**navailable attacker - the party using it as a sword was unavailable last time or could not have easily joined (they test this usually when the SEC brings an action against someone. I can't just join the SEC in the first action and be like it's now **SEC & SNOOGOAT VS. THE WORLD. YAY.** They'd be like ""fuck off""  
**N**o inconsistent judgments with the same issue (another court coming out an opposite way)  
**N**o more favorable procedure in a new suit that could tip the scales (that wouldn't be fair)

# Appeals 

You have to file a federal appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. In civil cases you must file a NOTICE saying you're going to appeal in the TRIAL COURT within **30 days of the final judgment.** 

The big issue in all these appeals is waiver. I talked to one federal appellate prosecutor and he laughed and said **""oh Goats... we argue waiver every time. Every fucking time.""** You can only appeal errors that you preserve by timely objecting in the trial court!!!!

**TWO EXCEPTIONS TO WAIVER REQUIREMENT:** 

**Plain or obvious error that affects SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS** (aka an enormous error the court thinks is so fucked up they just have to act even though you didn't object) 

MBE Tip: You don't have to object to a **missing jury instruction** if you asked for it and the court said ""no"" on the record. 

**Final Judgment Rule**

You can only appeal once the trial court has made a final decision on the merits of all the claims. 

You have a right to an ""interlocutory appeal"" (when it's not a final decision yet) in six key situations: HIT EM WITH AN **ICE PIC**CCCCCC BOI 

**I**njunctions  
**C**ontrolling issue (if the trial court **SAYS IN WRITING THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL GROUND FOR DIFFERENCE OF OPINION**, and **that an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the case.** If the trial court says this you can appeal to the appellate court within 10 days. THEY TEST ON THIS A LOT IN MBE STAY WOKE).   
**E**xtraordinary writ - this is like a writ of mandamus if the trial court does a MAJOR fuck up you can tell the appellate court to tell the judge he's lost his mind  
**P**artial final judgment. You can seek review of partial final judgments which the court may enter (if they expressly determine there's no just reason for delay)

**I**mportant collateral issues - issues too important to wait for. Immunity, trade secrets. 

**C**lass certification 

# Standards of Review

**Harmless errors** don't merit reversal. 

**Questions of Law get the (L)east deference.** De novo standard (clean slate, no facts taken into account). 

**Fact Decision** (jury is given more deference but both are given a lot of deference)

By Jury: only reversed if unsupported by **substantial evidence**

By judge: only reversed if **""clearly erroneous""**

**Discretionary decisions (abuse of discretion)** are given **substantial deference.** These are like when the law says the court may or may no something, like exclude evidence. They're only reversed for ""abuse of discretion"" when the judge steps beyond his legal bounds. 

Okay we're done - fuck civil procedure. I'm going to hit the hot tub. 

**GET SLEEP TONIGHT AND STAY POSITIVE.** Take NyQuil if you have to. 

Evidence will be my last one so I'll try to make it good =)

* Creating multi-member districts for elections to the House of Representatives, with each district having at least 3 members.
* Require the use of ranked choice voting, in particular single transferable vote, to elect members to the House.

That's why it's critical that lawmakers cosponsor H.R. 536/S.124, the Federal Adjustment of Income Rates (FAIR) Act, which would authorize an average 8.7% pay raise for federal employees in 2024.  

Federal wages and salaries need a substantial adjustment both to restore the living standards of federal employees and to help agencies recruit and retain a federal workforce capable of carrying out the crucial missions of our government.  

Not only are federal employees paid less than our counterparts in the private sector and state and local government, but our wages and salaries DO NOT begin to keep up with the cost of living.

It's time for lawmakers to show their support for the folks that keep our federal government running by cosponsoring the FAIR ACT.

49,10ov30d,t2_b250qzwp,"Fair Tax Act - Are my numbers right?I was hoping someone could help me out and maybe point out any mistakes or miscalculations I made.

I have spreadsheets of all the transactions I have ever made, so after hearing about this fair tax act I was initially concerned about losing more money to the fed, but after plugging them all into my sheets I am seeing nothing but a net positive and I'm confused why everyone is so upset about this change to the tax system.

I read that the fair tax act will abolish the IRS, which in turn will eliminate the Federal Income Tax, so I came up with 3 scenarios to base my numbers off of:

1. Federal Sales Tax (30%) + State Income Tax + State Sales Tax (10% IL)
2. Federal Sales Tax (30%) + State Sales Tax (10%)
3. Federal Sales Tax (30%) and No other Tax - very unlikely

In all of these scenarios my total taxes paid decreased and by a significant amount. I calculated around $200+ a month in reduction in just purchases that don't include rent, car insurance, car payments, utilities, and online flat rate services.

I am positive that this would have an effect on all of the things I excluded from my calculations but this 30% sales tax I'm reading about would be far cheaper than paying 12% income tax, especially as not everything I pay for monthly would be effected by this tax change, i.e. my car payments, I already payed the taxes with the loan when I got it, and it's a fixed rate so it shouldn't increase at all.

&#x200B;

Maybe someone could shed some more light on why this is such a bad thing for everyone but to be honest, I am seeing nothing but wins here?

EDIT:

I make 35k a year, spend roughly 24-25k

I only estimate about $6k of which would be effected by the sales tax directly.

I just got a car last year so I'm personally not worried about a future purchase of a vehicle.

I also don't expect my rent  or insurance rates to increase very much either, please give me evidence if you would think otherwise.  


  
EDIT EDIT:  


Not everyone in the US has to pay income tax- because not everyone in the US makes income from a hourly or salary job.

There are the super wealthy which make profit from investments, which are not taxable at the same rates as income.

There are under the table jobs people take and don't report when filing taxes. 

There are sales that you make in private which sometimes don't get reported when filing taxes.

&#x200B;

What this bill would do is remove taxable income from lower and middle class workers, while making everyone pay a sales tax, regardless of how they get their income.

I don't know much about economics, so I'm having a hard time trying to figure out if this is good or bad. I went through, I read most of the bill and skimmed some sections that seemed useless to the overall theme of the bill

1. What I picked out was there's a 23% sales tax that each individual reports and makes the payment to on the 15th of the month
   1. How are they going to determine that everything that's taxable is reported?
2. If you're a low income family you get \~15% (?) rebate paid at the end of every month (unless they owe you money for 60+ days then you get interest as well)
   1. They determine that by the poverty line. (which for my would be 1800/month) I make more than that, so I wouldn't qualify, but were on WIC right now, so bad for me?
3. The Social Security Administration handles this
   1. However Republicans want to defund the SSA, soooo?
4. They don't specify what's tax free. Currently food and clothes is tax free, and I didnt notice anything that keeps that.
   1. There is a note in the vending machine exception that since its under $10 it'll be tax free, did I just miss the section that discussed what specifically is taxed?
5. I didn't see anything that's really beneficial for the 1%. 
   1. Republicans love to cater to the 1%, so what's the deal here? Everything they do is for the 1%.
6. It seems like everything taxed is after the consumer receives it.
   1. No VAT? Would that mean that theres no tax whatsoever, making ""cost"" go down? In a perfect world, that means the cost of good go down, but I doubt it will

&#x200B;

My thoughts on the matter:

1. If I'm struggling, buying only food and clothes, I should have little to no tax, assuming they keep the ""necessity for survival"" idea we currently have.
2. If I'm making bank and buying Lamborghini's, I'm paying a lot into tax. The way I think it should be.
3. How is the SSA going to keep up with EVERYONE's rebates and credits, penalties and interest, on a monthly basis?
4. Nothings really stopping me from not reporting what I spent, until an audit happens, but its hard to audit consumables that have no evidence after garbage day.
5. If the only tax is collected at the final point of sale, then the cost of items, theoretically, should go down.
6. How are they going to handle amazon resellers? This ruins the amazon scalping business.
7. How does this work for people who buy Cricut machines and use that to sell stickers? Do they need a business license to prove they're not the final point of sale?
8. Republicans notoriously only help the rich, so what did I miss in this bill that helps the rich?
9. Everyone I see saying this bill is a bad idea say its a 30% tax, 35% tax; where do these numbers come from?
10. When I was a truck driver I got closer to a 25% (80k+) federal income tax, right now I'm at 12% (20/hr), but after my raise in May I'll be at 22% (31/hr). I get Sales Tax on top of that, so I should have more disposable income, right?
11. The people between the poverty line, and 31/hr might struggle quite a bit, assuming food and clothes is taxed. If they're not taxed then it should be pretty good for them.

&#x200B;

 What are your thoughts? Did I misinterpret anything? Like I said, I haven't studied very much economics and I don't know exactly how any of this would work. I just read the bill and drew conclusions. Everywhere I look it seems like this is a bad idea and I'm reluctant to trust republicans, given their track history (tbh democrats aren't that much better, it seems), but I'm having a hard time falling into the ""this is a bad idea"" boat.

&#x200B;

Sub note: I mentioned we get WIC, but my Fiancée is on it, when we get married there's a decent chance we will lose it in April,  but my son is due in March, so we will see.

51,10o72cg,t2_4zzvp,"Fair Tax Act sounds like a fraud to the less wealthy.I’m not knowledgeable. But my friends and I were just talking about the Fair Tax Act with no clue and realize it’s probably not good.

##———

A person who earns for example 3k a month and spend it all will have to pay 23% of his income as sales tax. That’s 

(3k * 23%) / 3k = 23%.

But a person who earns 30k a month who spend 6k only needs pay much less tax in percentage.

(6k * 23%) / 30k = 4.6%.

So if you earn more and spend more, you still pay less tax in percentage in some cases.

##———

For the less wealthy, the tax rate seems to increase from 10%+ to 23%.

But for the high income earners, it decreases from 30%+ to 10-%, for example.

For the ultra rich or cooperate, I’m *guessing* it’s going to be near 0%? (I’m just guessing maliciously)

##———

Big landlords whose rent income tax decrease from 30% or 20% to 0 (right?), and only pay 10%- sales tax, *will they decrease their rent, too?*

Cooperates who now don’t pay any tax in their profits, will they drop their prices?

##———

Again, I’m not knowledgeable. But it looks sus.

For the 23%, here is how I got it.

1 / (1 + 30% sales tax) = 77%

1 - 77% = 23% from income.",0.9003,positive,1/29/2023 6:57,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,not relevant,reddit

I notice a lot of posts on this sub praising the proposed FairTax, even though it’s an extremely regressive 22% sales tax that [raises the tax burden on 90% of taxpayers while only the top 10% receive a reduction in the tax burden](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-fair-tax-plan-pros-cons-effect-3305765#toc-studies-that-dont-support-the-fair-tax).

But perhaps my biggest question about the FairTax Act to Libertarians who support it is this;

**If we wanted to abolish the IRS and most taxes in favor of a single tax, why not go with the LVT?** 

Unlike sales tax, it’s actually progressive and doesn’t need additional deductions or exemptions to make sure poor people aren’t unnecessarily burdened with the single tax.

101,109gqa3,t2_12elra,"What do you think of the Fair Tax Act?This bill imposes a national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services in lieu of the current income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes. The rate of the sales tax will be 23% in 2023, with adjustments to the rate in subsequent years. There are exemptions from the tax for used and intangible property; for property or services purchased for business, export, or investment purposes; and for state government functions.

Under the bill, family members who are lawful U.S. residents receive a monthly sales tax rebate (Family Consumption Allowance) based upon criteria related to family size and poverty guidelines. (Effectively it's expanded TANF) 

The states have the responsibility for administering, collecting, and remitting the sales tax to the Treasury.

Tax revenues are to be allocated among (1) the general revenue, (2) the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund, (3) the disability insurance trust fund, (4) the hospital insurance trust fund, and (5) the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund.

No funding is authorized for the operations of the Internal Revenue Service after FY2025.

Argued pros:

It abolishes the IRS making it pretty much impossible to commit tax fraud. 

It incentivizes giving children inheritance earlier

It encourages people to sell and buy stock.

It makes budgeting for taxes easier. 
 


Argued cons:

It disincentivizes consumer purchasing. 

It incentivizes giving children inheritance earlier 

It uses a TANF structure, which is known to be less effective at reducing poverty than other welfare structures, though it could be arguable that this is not the purpose of the allowance.",0.9581,positive,1/11/2023 15:35,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,not relevant,reddit

I could find plenty of info about older drafts and versions but not much from today. The gist seems to be to get rid of the IRS, payroll tax, estate/gift taxes and transition to a higher consumption/sales tax. What I'm wondering is, would this really be a more fair taxation plan or is this more tax cuts for the wealthy? I haven't read the entire bill yet as I'm at work but will tonight, was just wondering if anyone knew more about this or could summarize/point towards any real world examples of something similar being implemented.

136,101hoh9,t2_1u1g5alb,"Landlord is requiring ""women only"" on their Zillow ad. How does the Fair Housing Act apply? (Virginia)Good day, reddit!

I (35M) will be moving and I am currently searching for a new place (Virginia). The most affordable options I'm seeing are for renting out a room in a house or apartment, but some ads are specifying women applicants only. My understanding is that this is not permitted, but are there exceptions or something that would make it so they can do this (e.g. there is a common space or something)? I feel like my application is great, so that wouldn't be a reason to deny me. What if they don't flat out say no, but instead choose to ignore me completely? Does rule change if the ads are publicly posted? Does posting an ad on a public platform (such as on Zillow), make it a public offering and thus subject to FHA?

edit:  I have no intention to actually push it unless I have absolutely no other choice (which most likely won't be the case). That sounds like a fantastic way of making sure your roommate hates you, which would make for a very unpleasant tenancy. Really this is more about curiosity since I see it all the time.

The FHA code:  [Code of Federal Regulations (govinfo.gov)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2017-title24-vol1/xml/CFR-2017-title24-vol1-part100.xml)

I can't find anything in the code that seems to make those exemptions.

If you'd like more details, I have them below.

Examples:

* 2 bed, 1 bath. Landlord renting one of two rooms in their house. The other room is occupied by another renting tenant **(NOT the owner)**. Ad says female only.
* 2 bed, 2 bath. Person is subletting a room in their apartment since their current roommate is moving out. Ad says ""looking for a female roomate.""

I have:

* Credit \~790,
* Income >$120k,
* No pets,
* a clean and clear background (i.e. no illegal activities), and
* I am looking for 12+ month lease,
* Within the time window they say they desire.",0.8107,positive,1/2/2023 11:08,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,not relevanr,reddit

191,zwmjyf,t2_12elra,"Fair labor standards actI work as a CNA in long-term health care. Over the blizzard in upstate New York my facility called a code 99 twice, that’s a disaster called meaning nobody can leave the building. The first time it was called I was forced to be in the building for 30 hours. After 18 hours they told me to take a four hour rest and then come back to work. Now that the weekend is over and payroll is closing tomorrow I have found out that our facility decided not to pay us for the four hour rest. We get overtime for anything after eight hours. So not only are we losing that four hours of pay but it resets our time clock, so the remaining, eight hours of my 30 is regular time instead of overtime pay. We don’t have a written policy regarding pay during a disaster code but our administrators have just made the decision to not pay us for the four hour rest. Is there anyone on this forum that can answer 
 To the legalities of the situation? Naomi where we forced to take a four hour restaurant we were never told it would be unpaid. We were informed that if we left the building, we would risk immediate termination. Im under the assumption, that if we are forced to be at work and we have to be paid for it. Sorry if there is any mistakes, I am driving and using my talk to text. I am happy to copy and paste some information I have found from the fair labor standards act on the Department of labor website. I’m also about to read our union contract although I don’t think it’s stage anything about disaster pay. I have an email typed out to our head administrators, but I’m scared to send it for fear of retaliation.

It's not the course of action I would've chosen, but it's a viable (if unexpected) decision given the morally gray story beats.

Here's the thing, though. They've constructed a bomb using a regular sized flask made out of cheap tin, filled it with blasting powder, and the party's archer is going to hit it at range with an explosive arrow (which does 1d8 + 4 fire damage in an explosive effect, if that factors into your judgment.)

I can't test this out in real life for obvious reasons, but even factoring the explosive nature of the arrow, I don't think a hip flask's worth of blasting powder would make that big of an explosion. (Seriously, the archer is lining up her shot from 100 yards.) But I'll admit that I don't know much about it in either direction. 

So, the ""bomb"" will be planted outside the target's hotel room, just on the floor. Assuming she pulls off the shot, how big/destructive an explosion should I allow?",-0.843,negative,12/13/2022 16:22,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,not relevant,reddit

Are there any politicians or groups actively pushing for this?

It is not clear to me that these laws are actively being pursued, and I don't see any timelines for passing them.

Is it possible for these to be passed by executive action?

I'm zooming through Illinois on a Southwest Chief 4 train, running 2.5 hours behind schedule, due to illegally dispatched BSNF trains.  
The train yesterday was almost 11 hours delayed.

This person said if you have a felony and you can make it to the courthouse without being purged you’ll get your record expunged. What the fuck?
