[Make it stop](https://i.redd.it/afr39v7i6tia1.gif)

Re-takers LET'S GET OURSELVES TOGETHER. WE ARE WALKING IN THERE [ON THIS TYPE OF TIME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqtJw67xM14)

We've got to do this one fast because I'm typing this at a Starbucks outside my work and there is a crazy homeless (I think the proper term is ""unhoused"" now) woman who keeps walking up to me and shaking her fist at me and yelling demonic shit. I've tried to calm her down by buying her the $6 egg-bites but I don't know how much longer I can hold her off. #JustChicagoThings.

**Let's Discover the magic of Discovery**

https://i.redd.it/9o41ig5vhtia1.gif

Okay anything **proportional** or **relevant** is discoverable. But you can't dig too **DEEP**

**D**uplicative - you can't request things which you've already asked for or would be duplicative

**E**asier way - there can't be an easier way to get it.

**E**nough opportunity - you need to allow enough of an opportunity to get the information yourself first.

**P**rivilege - no privileged info INCLUDING WORK PRODUCT (material prepared for in preparation for litigation) unless it contains unprivileged and relevant facts that CANNOT be discovered without undue hardship.

**Note:** You can get electronic stored information so long as it's reasonably accessible (burden and cost analysis).

**Real-world analysis:** I worked at a personal injury firm and pretty much any discovery we asked for the other side would just choose violence and respond and say ""this request is unduly burdensome and duplicative"" and just shut us down unless we asked for like... the name of the hospital or some shit lmao. This was my face when I'd spend 47 hours cooking up discovery requests as a 1L for $13 an hour and then get an e-mail back that every request was ""unduly burdensome and duplicative"":

[Brutal being a law clerk](https://i.redd.it/pckcts059tia1.gif)

**What happens if you just tell the other side to fuck off when they ask for discovery?**

[No discovery for you Andrew and Tristan Tate](https://preview.redd.it/hvfe0lxu7tia1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=952b6b5937a524fa52ac701db0ecd18104a872df)

You will be in big trouble with the judge and he will sanction your ass. They have these ""discovery"" motion calls in a lot of courts where you have to go in front of a badass angry judge and he will go NUTS on you if you didn't do the depositions or submit the interrogatories or requests to produce on time. They can **strike your pleadings**, **make you pay money**, **dismiss your case if you acted in bad faith, treat certain issues as decided against you.**

**Special MEE Tip:** The NCBE loves this scenario of ""electronic discovery"" being lost or deleted in bad faith. I imagine they have some 79 year old person in their office whose granddaughter showed them snapchat and they lean back in their chair and say ""a modern lawyer must know about the perils of the internet."" Basically in the problem some sketchy manager from Walmart will delete a recording of a slip and fall and deprive everyone of it. If the loss was intentional... there will be an adverse inference which means the judge will actually TELL the jury ""you can assume this was bad for the side that deleted it."" lmao... if the judge tells the jury some ominous shit like that, you are definitely losing. Juries HATE to feel like someone tried to pull a sneak move on them or trick them (from my experience of working in the civil and criminal courts and talking to juries after, they always bring up how **they don't like** **witnesses trying to deceive them)**

**Safe-Harbor provision for Electronic Discovery:** If they can show the information was deleted in the ""ordinary"" practices of the data retention policy of the business, they will escape this adverse inference. 

**What kind of Discovery is there?**

Up top we can note that we **ALWAYS** have a duty to **supplement** or **amend** disclosures that are discovered to be inaccurate or not fully complete. All discovery tendered must be certified by the attorney that it is proper.

**MANDATORY DISCLOSURES & INITIAL DISCLOSURES**

Okay so the attorneys have to have this thing called a ""discovery conference."" There's a ton of shit they need to decide. In a personal injury case it could be like ""expert witness depositions"", ""treating physician depositions"", ""party depositions"", ""completion of requests to produce and interrogatories."" So they get all this shit together and submit a ""plan"" to the court, and often the court has to address issues which they are fighting about. If they don't stick with the plan, judge goes insane and yells at everyone, sanctions, you get the drill.

And you can't get **SLIC**k with the other side, you must give them up front:

**S**upporting documents used to support your claim (so long as they are discoverable)

**L**ikely witnesses (names and contact info and subject matter of testimony)

**I**nsurance - any agreement that would involve an insurance company (this is statutory... insurance companies have LIENS and medicare and all these people will fuck your whole life up if they paid for your medical care then you won a million bucks and didn't pay them back)

**C**omputation of damages - you need a computation of all of your damages and evidence supporting the calculation of damages.

**Expert Disclosures**: You need to disclose expert testimony **90** days before trial. **MBE Trick Alert:** If the expert disclosure is just being used to **REBUT** the other side's expert, it only has be disclosed **30 days** before trial. (Yes, they are really this petty to test us on this).

You need at LEAST an expert summary report but many courts require a complete written expert report with his opinion, the basis, exhibits, AND his **compensation** and **OTHER CASES THEY TESTIFIED ON.** (This is why personal injury lawyers will be like ""we can't use Johnny cardiologist, he's a SLUT. He has testified for plaintiff's 194 times in the last four years). The lawyers WILL ask the expert what they are making for their testimony and it always blows the juries mind apart. They will ask some top-tier machiavellian 14 time board certified-cardiologist xeno-millionaire professional expert witness cardiologist department head at Northwestern who is also a part-time member of the Bohemian Grove how much he's being paid to be there and testify for 6 hours and he'll be like ""$37,000"". The jury will just go completely quiet and stare silently at their $16 per day check from the county and their minds will be shattered by the harsh realities of this world.

**Pretrial Disclosures:** You must give detailed information about the evidence you plan on presenting at least **30 days** prior to trial. 

**Forms of Discovery:** Discovery comes in many forms including (1) depositions, (2) interrogatories, (3) requests to admit, (4) requests to produce, and (5) requests for physical or mental examinations. 

Let's talk **deps** 

[It was all Sunny Balwani's fault](https://i.redd.it/i73zdat46tia1.gif)

[She doesn't remember anything about the Edison](https://i.redd.it/n071ai186tia1.gif)

Deps are interviews with witnesses under oath before trial (written or oral). **One per witness, and ten total.** 7 hours max. Organizations are deposed through a **designated agent** who knows shit about what you want to talk about. 

**ROGS:** Written questions answered under oath. 25 allowed. 

**Requests to Admit**: Requesting the other side to admit facts and the authenticity of documents and shit about the law. You can make as many as you want before discovery closes. If they don't answer or object within 30 days, the requests are deemed admitted. Beware, if you fuck this up it will destroy your chance at winning the lawsuit (you'll end up admitting everything lol). 

**Requests to Produce:** Documents, electronic shit, tangible items. They need to be reasonable. 

**Requests for physical or mental examination:** only allowed if the court says so and a party's **""health"" must be in controversy** and you can't get it through other means. 

**Pretrial Orders:** Judge sets pretrial conferences to try and move the lawsuit along and foster settlement negotiations. He sets deadlines. Then releases a **FINAL PRETRIAL ORDER** to decide which evidence and issues the trial is allowed to be on. Uh oh... what if what you want to talk about is not in the final pretrial order? The court can amend that but **only to prevent manifest injustice**. Remember that for the MBE, they test on it. The MBE is just seeing if you can memorize all these stupid little key phrases and then pick them at the right time haha. **But as Grossman says, EACH QUESTION ONLY TESTS ON ONE THING. DO NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY THESE MBE QUESTIONS. OH THE QUESTION IS ABOUT FINAL PRETRIAL ORDERS? I WONDER WHAT THE ANSWER COULD BE....** 

THE ANSWER WILL SAY ""TO PREVENT MANIFEST INJUSTICE."" [They CANNOT TRICK US BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO USE THE MAGICAL WORDS IN THE ANSWER CHOICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l60MnDJklnM)

# The Motion of the Ocean 

Okay so motions generally have to be served 14 days before the hearing and they generally need an affidavit (sworn statement). Opposing affidavits need to be served 7 days before the hearing. 

Prior to answering the complaint you can just immediately hit them with a 12(b) motion to fuck the other sides whole life up. 

You can file a 12(b) for insufficient process or service, improper court (lack of SMJ, PJ or venue), or failure to state a claim meriting relief or failure to join a required party. 

**The MBE loves this failure to state a claim shit**. This one I always found kind of funny when I worked at the court. These pro se crackheads would come in and file 957 page motions against the city and then the city attorney would appear for 37 seconds and be like ""yea your honor I read this shit, there is not a single element of a prima facie case anywhere alleging anything even remotely cognizable."" Then the pro se person goes NUTS and give a legit SPEECH about sovereign citizenship for 147 minutes while the judge sits there totally stunned. 

[Then the judge says this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c)

You can put these in the answer instead of the 12(b) motion too. If you don't put them in either, you waive process for service issues and improper PJ and venue defenses. **You can never waive SMJ defenses, because the court always wants to know whether it can actually hear the case.** 

**Facial Attacks of Motion** 

You can also attack the face of the complaint. You can ask for **a more definite statement** (by asking specifically what additional details you desire) and the other side has 14 days to obey or the pleading will be STRUCK. 

You can move for a **judgment on the pleadings** after all the pleadings are closed too. This is kind of like a motion to dismiss. 

You can **move to strike** the offending parts of the motion before filing a response. **Real World Analysis:** I was so happy to help my boss on a motion to challenge the credibility of a confidential informant when I got my first job in private criminal defense a few years back and I worked so hard on it. My boss insisted that we could challenge the judge's private evaluation of the confidential informant she met with (she found him credible) and we tried to say basically that **the judge had bad judgment**. My 97 year old boss did not know you couldn't challenge the judge's credibility determination of a confidential source and the state just immediately moved to strike the whole pleading with one sentence only 30 minutes after I submitted it: ""This pleading is tantamount to an insinuation that the court and by extension the judge herself is not fit to determine the credibility of a confidential source whom she met with privately for over an hour. Move to strike."" ............... **I never recovered from that first motion.** 

[My face after reading it](https://i.redd.it/d2oc4w06jtia1.gif)

**The Legend of FRCP 56 and the Summary Judgment Motion** 

This one is kind of funny. You're basically like ""look... we are not actually in a fight. we don't even have a material dispute here to bring to a jury since you basically agree that I'm the shit."" 

Summary judgment can be brought when one or more material facts are not disputed or absent and the absent or undisputed facts entitle you to at least partial judgment as a matter of law. 

You can bring it before trial up until **30 days after discovery closes.** 

You need to **POINT TO THE RECORD** and affidavits based on personal knowledge. You're like ""HOMIE - LOOK AT THIS PATHETIC RECORD YOU SUBMITTED. SHOW ME SOME ACTUAL STUFF WHICH SAYS YOU ARE NOT AGREEING I AM RIGHT."" Then the non-moving party has to point to affidavits, depositions, documents, admissions, interrogatories and say ""go fuck yourself, there are genuine issues of material fact such that this SHOULD be put before a tribunal good sir."" Court then views it in the light most favorable to the NON-MOVANT. **MBE Trick:** Someone will give some bullshit affidavit based on the knowledge of their grandma or something. Affidavits need to be based on **PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.** 

**It's JMOL Time.** 

This is when you're like ""Judge... let's not even embarrass ourselves by giving this to the jury. This simple minded idiot who I'm up against didn't even present ANY evidence on one or more of the material elements... so a jury will just be in there watching Rick and Morty and have nothing to talk about. Please take it out of their hands and award me my trophy now and let's get home to watch Yellowstone."" You can bring this after the opposing party has presented all its evidence or before jury submission. This is an extraordinary remedy and the judge would literally be taking the case away from the jury, but it happens (even when small fuck ups happen like a states attorney doesn't ask the witness to identify the attacker in court... identity is needed and case gets JMAULED"" 

**Post-Trial Motions** 

Renewed JMOL and Motion for New Trial must be filed **28 days later** after entry of a judgment (remember the Zombie movie). 

**Renewed JMOL** is basically the same thing as **JMOL**... you're literally saying ""no reasonable jury could have reached this verdict, take it away from them after they've already rendered it."" **MBE Tip:** Guys... stop playing. If you don't file the first **JMOL**, you can't file a renewed **JMOL. THEY TEST ON THIS AND IT IS A FREE POINT.** 

**Motion for New Trial:** 

**Motions to Set Aside Judgment aka motion for relief:** Mistake, neglect, new evidence that couldn't have been discovered, and fraud must be brought in a reasonable time **not to exceed one year.** 

You can kinda remember these by thinking of this phrase  **""Me or you messed it up or crazy shit happened = 1 year""** 

Clerical errors, void, satisfied, or discharged judgment, or any other reason must be brought in a **reasonable time**. They actually test this... so remember the three which are one year max. 

# What Laws Should We Use? 

Okay normally if it's state court only involving state claims we are just using the laws of that state. In federal court with only federal claims, then obviously it's federal law that applies. 

but shit gets **fucking wild** in these federal diversity cases or **federal question cases with supplemental state law issues involved.** 

**WHAT IF THERE IS NO CONFLICT GOAT?** 

One time I was zooming in a finals study session with an ULTRA gunner (who always had to be right, he was ranked like second in our class) and I told him about this concept and he argued with me. Then he got so mad he signed off the zoom. All I said was that if there is a **federal law on point**, and that law does not conflict with a state law, you just apply the federal law on point. He thought I was trying to be narcy and was like ""what are you even talking about bro? ""federal law on point"" (he used bunny ears) what the fuck does that mean. you are trying to sound smart. it's always an Erie issue with diversity bro, it's always an Erie issue."" Then suddenly I was the only screen on the zoom. This actually happened.  

[Me explaining his meltdown later to my law school friends after 4 shots of tequila:](https://i.redd.it/oxak6cqgptia1.gif)

**Sorry Hayden**, it's not ""always an Erie issue""

**But what if it is an Erie issue?** 

If there's a conflict between federal and state laws, **Erie** just says you must apply federal procedural law and state substantive law. The whole purpose of Erie is uniformity - they want the result in Fed court to be the same as the result in state court. The whole difficult part about Erie is **determining which laws are procedural and which laws are substantive.** 

**First you gotta determine if it's procedural or substantive.** 

Procedural is like filing deadlines, court rules and procedures, discovery practices, rules of evidence. All the shit that helps the court run. The **processes and procedures of the court.** If it's procedural, federal law governs. 

Substantive is like the **legal rights & duties** involved in the case are affected. Elements of claim or defense, burdens of proof, statute of limitations, choice of law rules.  If it's substantive, state law governs. 

**If it's UNCLEAR, then it's a two-step process**

**Step 1: Is there a fed law on point?** If yes, use that. If no, move to step two. (they will tell you in the problem like an FRCP law is ""on point"" or something and then because of the supremacy clause we have to use that law over the state law)

**Step 2: If there isn't any federal law on point you have to look at the 3 approaches.** 

**Outcome determinative:** Apply state law if ignoring the state rule affects the outcome of the case. (sufficiency of minimum contacts, effect of res judicata, burden of proof, conflict choice of law rules)

**Balance of interests:** which court system has a stronger interest in having the issue resolved? heavier side wins on the scale. 

**Avoid forum shopping:** Federal court will apply state law if not following it will cause people to flood the fed courts and consciously forum shop. 

**But Goat, are there any things which are unclear that they like to test on?** 

Yes. Immunity, statute of frauds issues and PAROL, limits on damages, testimonial privileges. These are in kind of a gray area. 

# Jury Trials 

The 7th amendment gives you a federal right to a jury in most civil cases (except that one dumbass problem where a writ of ejectment in 1812 was not considered a cognizable claim based on Wonson or some shit lol). If the court is awarding legal relief aka $$$ DAMAGES, you are getting that jury. If it's just equitable relief... they are fine with you just bringing that in front of the judge. If there are both legal and equitable claims, legal claims must be tried first. Always just remember [to get the money FIRST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7NyNnwrm70)

You need a jury demand in your complaint or answer or you could file a demand within **14 days** of the last pleading that put the issue of damages on the table. Otherwise, it's waived. 

**Voire Dire ""to speak the truth"" -** This is the jury selection process. Weeding out people who could fuck up the fairness of the trial. Bias can be presumed in certain situations like employment relations or if they have stock in a company which is represented in the trial or if a family member or anyone they know is involved. **The judge or attorney just asks a shitload of questions to people about if they will be biased and most of them just answer to try and get out of the jury process lol. Then the judge yells at them.** 

You get unlimited strikes for cause. Three peremptory strikes without cause (sometimes more), so LONG as they are not based on **race or gender** (this is called a BATSON challenge when someone accuses you of this and you'll get in trouble with the licensing board if you are found to be doing this). 

Federal jury trial has six to twelve members. Must be at least 6 and unanimous verdict. 

**Jury Instructions** 

Jury instructions take place before jury deliberation, but additional instructions may be given at any time. Requests for jury instructions are written and filed and given to the other side. Before instructing the jury, the court hears the proposed instructions and allows them to object on the record (these instructions are often a basis for appeal so there is a lot of battle about them, I'm not really sure the jury is even listening when they are read though haha). 

To make a proper objection to the jury instructions you need to **TOSS** the football into the touchdown zone (yes I am a jock and watched the football game the other night) 

[Proof that I am into sports and watched it at this weird club. yes I am wearing lion socks ](https://preview.redd.it/iyh44qw5ztia1.jpg?width=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8ded3f47911b1e427020d16be6b7491f69787e52)

**T**imely - you must object when the court gathers to discuss the instructions. If you don't know about them later, you can object ""promptly upon finding out."" (MBE tests this)

**O**n the record 

**S**pecify what you're objecting to 

**S**pecify why you're objecting 

# Verdicts & Judgments 

**Default Judgment:** When the clerk or judge enters in a parties favor because the other party failed to defend. 

Clerk can enter default if she is going to **NASA** on Bezos' new private NASA trips. 

**N**ot minor or incompetent  
**A**bsent or failed to timely answer or appear   
**S**um certain (can be computed with certainty)  
**A**ffidavit - you requested with a damn affidavit. 

Otherwise judge enters if any of these NASA factors get fucked up. 

Default can be set aside if you show good cause for failure within a reasonable time, but NOT later than a year after default. Good cause is like **fraud, mistake, neglect.** 

**Dismissal**: Only the plaintiff can voluntarily dismiss a case. lol... the defendant can't voluntarily dismiss a case they didn't file. 

**Voluntary dismissal** is allowed when you file a notice of dismissal before the other side answers or motions for summary judgment or if you get a **stipulation** by all parties. You can only do this once for the same claim without prejudice. 

**A case can always be voluntarily dismissed with a court order without prejudice. If daddy judge says ANYTHING, then it shall be so.** 

Involuntary dismissal is if you fail to move the case along or don't obey court rules or you're just being a total shithead. 

**Jury Verdict** 

Two types: special and general. Both are written. 

**Special verdicts** make the jury decide on individual issues of FACT rather than the overall disposition of the case. they'll be like ""did you think Johnny had a gun? was Johnny a bad boy?"" 

**general verdicts** are general, they decide the overall case. 

**MBE ALERT:** They always test when the specific issues the jury decided don't make sense. The jury will decide like (1) Johnny is a bad boy, then (2) Johnny is a good boy, then (3) Johnny is innocent, and (4) Johnny killed everyone. Then the court is like wtf did these idiots just hand me. 

If this happens judge can (1) ask jury to reconsider, (2) order a new trial. If specific answers are consistent though (EVEN IF THE GENERAL OVERALL VERDICT IS INCONSISTENT WITH SPECIFIC) he can enter an order **consistent with the specific answers.** 

**Note:** When it's a bench trial the judge must state specific findings of fact on the record or in an opinion. **MBE Tip:** No... it does not always have to be written. He can just say that shit. Yes, you can challenge a judge's finding of fact with a motion for new trial. **Unfortunately for you, the person deciding it will be the judge himself lol.** 

**Claim Preclusion** 

Can you just keep suing someone on the same claim? No. **Same claim, same parties, and valid final judgment on the merits.** 123. Then you can only sue once you greedy bastard. 

But how will you remember this...?

Throw on your **VeST** and let's go out and dance the night away (Chiraq gang message me privately about this, we will be getting wasted at a specified date or time after this test). 

**V**alid, final judgment on the merits (case 1 must have ended this way obvi) 

**e** (I didn't have anything for this one)

**S**ame parties OR THEIR PRIVIES (privies are like people legally connected to them, don't forget this shit)

**T**ransactionally related claim - was or should have been raised in prior case. 

**Issue Preclusion** 

But Grossman is sad he didn't get to come to the party and dance the night away with us. He was with his vegan wife watching football (a sport I love). 

So he told us ""don't issue preclude me, I'm a **VIP** and I want to have **FUNN""**

(issue preclusion elements)

**V**alid final judgment on the merits  
**I**dentical issue litigated and actually NECESSARILY decided (not just some shit they dealt with in passing)  
**P**arty precluded was adequately represented as a party or privy 

When Grossman is NOT a party to the prior case (and using it offensively as a SWORD) it can't be unfair and has to be **FUNN** 

**F**oreseeable future suits (future lawsuits about the issue were foreseeable)  
**U**navailable attacker - the party using it as a sword was unavailable last time or could not have easily joined (they test this usually when the SEC brings an action against someone. I can't just join the SEC in the first action and be like it's now **SEC & SNOOGOAT VS. THE WORLD. YAY.** They'd be like ""fuck off""  
**N**o inconsistent judgments with the same issue (another court coming out an opposite way)  
**N**o more favorable procedure in a new suit that could tip the scales (that wouldn't be fair)

# Appeals 

You have to file a federal appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. In civil cases you must file a NOTICE saying you're going to appeal in the TRIAL COURT within **30 days of the final judgment.** 

The big issue in all these appeals is waiver. I talked to one federal appellate prosecutor and he laughed and said **""oh Goats... we argue waiver every time. Every fucking time.""** You can only appeal errors that you preserve by timely objecting in the trial court!!!!

**TWO EXCEPTIONS TO WAIVER REQUIREMENT:** 

**Plain or obvious error that affects SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS** (aka an enormous error the court thinks is so fucked up they just have to act even though you didn't object) 

MBE Tip: You don't have to object to a **missing jury instruction** if you asked for it and the court said ""no"" on the record. 

**Final Judgment Rule**

You can only appeal once the trial court has made a final decision on the merits of all the claims. 

You have a right to an ""interlocutory appeal"" (when it's not a final decision yet) in six key situations: HIT EM WITH AN **ICE PIC**CCCCCC BOI 

**I**njunctions  
**C**ontrolling issue (if the trial court **SAYS IN WRITING THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL GROUND FOR DIFFERENCE OF OPINION**, and **that an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the case.** If the trial court says this you can appeal to the appellate court within 10 days. THEY TEST ON THIS A LOT IN MBE STAY WOKE).   
**E**xtraordinary writ - this is like a writ of mandamus if the trial court does a MAJOR fuck up you can tell the appellate court to tell the judge he's lost his mind  
**P**artial final judgment. You can seek review of partial final judgments which the court may enter (if they expressly determine there's no just reason for delay)

**I**mportant collateral issues - issues too important to wait for. Immunity, trade secrets. 

**C**lass certification 

# Standards of Review

**Harmless errors** don't merit reversal. 

**Questions of Law get the (L)east deference.** De novo standard (clean slate, no facts taken into account). 

**Fact Decision** (jury is given more deference but both are given a lot of deference)

By Jury: only reversed if unsupported by **substantial evidence**

By judge: only reversed if **""clearly erroneous""**

**Discretionary decisions (abuse of discretion)** are given **substantial deference.** These are like when the law says the court may or may no something, like exclude evidence. They're only reversed for ""abuse of discretion"" when the judge steps beyond his legal bounds. 

Okay we're done - fuck civil procedure. I'm going to hit the hot tub. 

**GET SLEEP TONIGHT AND STAY POSITIVE.** Take NyQuil if you have to. 

Evidence will be my last one so I'll try to make it good =)

That's why it's critical that lawmakers cosponsor H.R. 536/S.124, the Federal Adjustment of Income Rates (FAIR) Act, which would authorize an average 8.7% pay raise for federal employees in 2024.  

Federal wages and salaries need a substantial adjustment both to restore the living standards of federal employees and to help agencies recruit and retain a federal workforce capable of carrying out the crucial missions of our government.  

Not only are federal employees paid less than our counterparts in the private sector and state and local government, but our wages and salaries DO NOT begin to keep up with the cost of living.

It's time for lawmakers to show their support for the folks that keep our federal government running by cosponsoring the FAIR ACT.

10ov30d,t2_b250qzwp,"Fair Tax Act - Are my numbers right?I was hoping someone could help me out and maybe point out any mistakes or miscalculations I made.

I have spreadsheets of all the transactions I have ever made, so after hearing about this fair tax act I was initially concerned about losing more money to the fed, but after plugging them all into my sheets I am seeing nothing but a net positive and I'm confused why everyone is so upset about this change to the tax system.

I read that the fair tax act will abolish the IRS, which in turn will eliminate the Federal Income Tax, so I came up with 3 scenarios to base my numbers off of:

1. Federal Sales Tax (30%) + State Income Tax + State Sales Tax (10% IL)
2. Federal Sales Tax (30%) + State Sales Tax (10%)
3. Federal Sales Tax (30%) and No other Tax - very unlikely

In all of these scenarios my total taxes paid decreased and by a significant amount. I calculated around $200+ a month in reduction in just purchases that don't include rent, car insurance, car payments, utilities, and online flat rate services.

I am positive that this would have an effect on all of the things I excluded from my calculations but this 30% sales tax I'm reading about would be far cheaper than paying 12% income tax, especially as not everything I pay for monthly would be effected by this tax change, i.e. my car payments, I already payed the taxes with the loan when I got it, and it's a fixed rate so it shouldn't increase at all.

&#x200B;

Maybe someone could shed some more light on why this is such a bad thing for everyone but to be honest, I am seeing nothing but wins here?

EDIT:

I make 35k a year, spend roughly 24-25k

I only estimate about $6k of which would be effected by the sales tax directly.

I just got a car last year so I'm personally not worried about a future purchase of a vehicle.

I also don't expect my rent  or insurance rates to increase very much either, please give me evidence if you would think otherwise.  


  
EDIT EDIT:  


Not everyone in the US has to pay income tax- because not everyone in the US makes income from a hourly or salary job.

There are the super wealthy which make profit from investments, which are not taxable at the same rates as income.

There are under the table jobs people take and don't report when filing taxes. 

There are sales that you make in private which sometimes don't get reported when filing taxes.

&#x200B;

What this bill would do is remove taxable income from lower and middle class workers, while making everyone pay a sales tax, regardless of how they get their income.

10oe5mx,t2_cu1fcz1l,"The Fair Tax ActHello!

I don't know much about economics, so I'm having a hard time trying to figure out if this is good or bad. I went through, I read most of the bill and skimmed some sections that seemed useless to the overall theme of the bill

1. What I picked out was there's a 23% sales tax that each individual reports and makes the payment to on the 15th of the month
   1. How are they going to determine that everything that's taxable is reported?
2. If you're a low income family you get \~15% (?) rebate paid at the end of every month (unless they owe you money for 60+ days then you get interest as well)
   1. They determine that by the poverty line. (which for my would be 1800/month) I make more than that, so I wouldn't qualify, but were on WIC right now, so bad for me?
3. The Social Security Administration handles this
   1. However Republicans want to defund the SSA, soooo?
4. They don't specify what's tax free. Currently food and clothes is tax free, and I didnt notice anything that keeps that.
   1. There is a note in the vending machine exception that since its under $10 it'll be tax free, did I just miss the section that discussed what specifically is taxed?
5. I didn't see anything that's really beneficial for the 1%. 
   1. Republicans love to cater to the 1%, so what's the deal here? Everything they do is for the 1%.
6. It seems like everything taxed is after the consumer receives it.
   1. No VAT? Would that mean that theres no tax whatsoever, making ""cost"" go down? In a perfect world, that means the cost of good go down, but I doubt it will

&#x200B;

My thoughts on the matter:

1. If I'm struggling, buying only food and clothes, I should have little to no tax, assuming they keep the ""necessity for survival"" idea we currently have.
2. If I'm making bank and buying Lamborghini's, I'm paying a lot into tax. The way I think it should be.
3. How is the SSA going to keep up with EVERYONE's rebates and credits, penalties and interest, on a monthly basis?
4. Nothings really stopping me from not reporting what I spent, until an audit happens, but its hard to audit consumables that have no evidence after garbage day.
5. If the only tax is collected at the final point of sale, then the cost of items, theoretically, should go down.
6. How are they going to handle amazon resellers? This ruins the amazon scalping business.
7. How does this work for people who buy Cricut machines and use that to sell stickers? Do they need a business license to prove they're not the final point of sale?
8. Republicans notoriously only help the rich, so what did I miss in this bill that helps the rich?
9. Everyone I see saying this bill is a bad idea say its a 30% tax, 35% tax; where do these numbers come from?
10. When I was a truck driver I got closer to a 25% (80k+) federal income tax, right now I'm at 12% (20/hr), but after my raise in May I'll be at 22% (31/hr). I get Sales Tax on top of that, so I should have more disposable income, right?
11. The people between the poverty line, and 31/hr might struggle quite a bit, assuming food and clothes is taxed. If they're not taxed then it should be pretty good for them.

&#x200B;

 What are your thoughts? Did I misinterpret anything? Like I said, I haven't studied very much economics and I don't know exactly how any of this would work. I just read the bill and drew conclusions. Everywhere I look it seems like this is a bad idea and I'm reluctant to trust republicans, given their track history (tbh democrats aren't that much better, it seems), but I'm having a hard time falling into the ""this is a bad idea"" boat.

10o72cg,t2_4zzvp,"Fair Tax Act sounds like a fraud to the less wealthy.I’m not knowledgeable. But my friends and I were just talking about the Fair Tax Act with no clue and realize it’s probably not good.

##———

A person who earns for example 3k a month and spend it all will have to pay 23% of his income as sales tax. That’s 

(3k * 23%) / 3k = 23%.

But a person who earns 30k a month who spend 6k only needs pay much less tax in percentage.

(6k * 23%) / 30k = 4.6%.

So if you earn more and spend more, you still pay less tax in percentage in some cases.

##———

For the less wealthy, the tax rate seems to increase from 10%+ to 23%.

But for the high income earners, it decreases from 30%+ to 10-%, for example.

For the ultra rich or cooperate, I’m *guessing* it’s going to be near 0%? (I’m just guessing maliciously)

##———

Big landlords whose rent income tax decrease from 30% or 20% to 0 (right?), and only pay 10%- sales tax, *will they decrease their rent, too?*

Cooperates who now don’t pay any tax in their profits, will they drop their prices?

##———

Again, I’m not knowledgeable. But it looks sus.

For the 23%, here is how I got it.

1 / (1 + 30% sales tax) = 77%

1 - 77% = 23% from income.",0.9003,positive,1/29/2023 6:57,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

This article I was reading gives an example of buying goods worth $100 at the store, you would pay $30 in sales tax for a total of $130. This means it’s 30%, not 23%.

(Also my criticism of the FairTax Act)I’ve been thinking more and more about the proposed FairTax Act being pushed by Republicans and how long it’s been promoted over the years. I notice a lot of posts on this sub praising the proposed FairTax, even though it’s an extremely regressive 22% sales tax that [raises the tax burden on 90% of taxpayers while only the top 10% receive a reduction in the tax burden](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/what-is-the-fair-tax-plan-pros-cons-effect-3305765#toc-studies-that-dont-support-the-fair-tax).

But perhaps my biggest question about the FairTax Act to Libertarians who support it is this;

**If we wanted to abolish the IRS and most taxes in favor of a single tax, why not go with the LVT?** 

Unlike sales tax, it’s actually progressive and doesn’t need additional deductions or exemptions to make sure poor people aren’t unnecessarily burdened with the single tax. Also, [libertarian economists like Milton Friedman noted how the LVT is the most fair form of taxation that currently exists](https://www.econlib.org/land-taxes-the-return-of-henry-george/).

109gqa3,t2_12elra,"What do you think of the Fair Tax Act?This bill imposes a national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services in lieu of the current income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate and gift taxes. The rate of the sales tax will be 23% in 2023, with adjustments to the rate in subsequent years. There are exemptions from the tax for used and intangible property; for property or services purchased for business, export, or investment purposes; and for state government functions.

Under the bill, family members who are lawful U.S. residents receive a monthly sales tax rebate (Family Consumption Allowance) based upon criteria related to family size and poverty guidelines. (Effectively it's expanded TANF) 

The states have the responsibility for administering, collecting, and remitting the sales tax to the Treasury.

Tax revenues are to be allocated among (1) the general revenue, (2) the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund, (3) the disability insurance trust fund, (4) the hospital insurance trust fund, and (5) the federal supplementary medical insurance trust fund.

No funding is authorized for the operations of the Internal Revenue Service after FY2025.

Finally, the bill terminates the national sales tax if the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution (authorizing an income tax) is not repealed within seven years after the enactment of this 


Argued pros:

It abolishes the IRS making it pretty much impossible to commit tax fraud. 

It incentivizes giving children inheritance earlier

It encourages people to sell and buy stock.

It makes budgeting for taxes easier. 
 


Argued cons:

It disincentivizes consumer purchasing. 

It incentivizes giving children inheritance earlier 

It uses a TANF structure, which is known to be less effective at reducing poverty than other welfare structures, though it could be arguable that this is not the purpose of the allowance.",0.9581,positive,1/11/2023 15:35,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

I could find plenty of info about older drafts and versions but not much from today. The gist seems to be to get rid of the IRS, payroll tax, estate/gift taxes and transition to a higher consumption/sales tax. What I'm wondering is, would this really be a more fair taxation plan or is this more tax cuts for the wealthy? I haven't read the entire bill yet as I'm at work but will tonight, was just wondering if anyone knew more about this or could summarize/point towards any real world examples of something similar being implemented.

101hoh9,t2_1u1g5alb,"Landlord is requiring ""women only"" on their Zillow ad. How does the Fair Housing Act apply? (Virginia)Good day, reddit!

I (35M) will be moving and I am currently searching for a new place (Virginia). The most affordable options I'm seeing are for renting out a room in a house or apartment, but some ads are specifying women applicants only. My understanding is that this is not permitted, but are there exceptions or something that would make it so they can do this (e.g. there is a common space or something)? I feel like my application is great, so that wouldn't be a reason to deny me. What if they don't flat out say no, but instead choose to ignore me completely? Does rule change if the ads are publicly posted? Does posting an ad on a public platform (such as on Zillow), make it a public offering and thus subject to FHA?

edit:  I have no intention to actually push it unless I have absolutely no other choice (which most likely won't be the case). That sounds like a fantastic way of making sure your roommate hates you, which would make for a very unpleasant tenancy. Really this is more about curiosity since I see it all the time.

The FHA code:  [Code of Federal Regulations (govinfo.gov)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2017-title24-vol1/xml/CFR-2017-title24-vol1-part100.xml)

I can't find anything in the code that seems to make those exemptions.

If you'd like more details, I have them below.

Examples:

* 2 bed, 1 bath. Landlord renting one of two rooms in their house. The other room is occupied by another renting tenant **(NOT the owner)**. Ad says female only.
* 2 bed, 2 bath. Person is subletting a room in their apartment since their current roommate is moving out. Ad says ""looking for a female roomate.""

I have:

* Credit \~790,
* Income >$120k,
* No pets,
* a clean and clear background (i.e. no illegal activities), and
* I am looking for 12+ month lease,
* Within the time window they say they desire.",0.8107,positive,1/2/2023 11:08,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

zwmjyf,t2_12elra,"Fair labor standards actI work as a CNA in long-term health care. Over the blizzard in upstate New York my facility called a code 99 twice, that’s a disaster called meaning nobody can leave the building. The first time it was called I was forced to be in the building for 30 hours. After 18 hours they told me to take a four hour rest and then come back to work. Now that the weekend is over and payroll is closing tomorrow I have found out that our facility decided not to pay us for the four hour rest. We get overtime for anything after eight hours. So not only are we losing that four hours of pay but it resets our time clock, so the remaining, eight hours of my 30 is regular time instead of overtime pay. We don’t have a written policy regarding pay during a disaster code but our administrators have just made the decision to not pay us for the four hour rest. Is there anyone on this forum that can answer 
 To the legalities of the situation? Naomi where we forced to take a four hour restaurant we were never told it would be unpaid. We were informed that if we left the building, we would risk immediate termination. Im under the assumption, that if we are forced to be at work and we have to be paid for it. Sorry if there is any mistakes, I am driving and using my talk to text. I am happy to copy and paste some information I have found from the fair labor standards act on the Department of labor website. I’m also about to read our union contract although I don’t think it’s stage anything about disaster pay. I have an email typed out to our head administrators, but I’m scared to send it for fear of retaliation.

It's not the course of action I would've chosen, but it's a viable (if unexpected) decision given the morally gray story beats.

Here's the thing, though. They've constructed a bomb using a regular sized flask made out of cheap tin, filled it with blasting powder, and the party's archer is going to hit it at range with an explosive arrow (which does 1d8 + 4 fire damage in an explosive effect, if that factors into your judgment.)

I can't test this out in real life for obvious reasons, but even factoring the explosive nature of the arrow, I don't think a hip flask's worth of blasting powder would make that big of an explosion. (Seriously, the archer is lining up her shot from 100 yards.) But I'll admit that I don't know much about it in either direction. 

So, the ""bomb"" will be planted outside the target's hotel room, just on the floor. Assuming she pulls off the shot, how big/destructive an explosion should I allow?",-0.843,negative,12/13/2022 16:22,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

It is not clear to me that these laws are actively being pursued, and I don't see any timelines for passing them.

Is it possible for these to be passed by executive action?

I'm zooming through Illinois on a Southwest Chief 4 train, running 2.5 hours behind schedule, due to illegally dispatched BSNF trains.  
The train yesterday was almost 11 hours delayed.

I drive for ride share and had a very obvious doomsday prepper over sharing with me about how they’re going off grid before everything ends. They told me about “the Indiana Purge Law” that acts like the movie Purge and allows you to do whatever you want for a certain amount of time, including murder. This person said if you have a felony and you can make it to the courthouse without being purged you’ll get your record expunged. What the fuck?

x94pro,t2_5855qflx,"Illinois Safe-T Act? What is the deal?I'm seeing a new fear-mongering campaign declaring that the Safe-T act will make things such as ""2nd degree murder"", burglary, kidnapping etc. ""non-detainable"" offenses.

Best I can tell, the Safe-T Act mostly does away with cash bail and requires body cams...I read through the legislation best I could and found nothing about ""non-detainable offenses"".

xfy6md,t2_29cqp8uh,"Kankakee County States Attorney Files Lawsuit to Declare SAFE-T Act Unconstitutional.KANKAKEE, IL – On September 16, 2022, State’s Attorney Jim Rowe filed a lawsuit in the Kankakee County Circuit Court asking that HB3653, the “Safe-T Act”, be held unconstitutional.  The lawsuit is filed on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois by Jim Rowe in his capacity as State’s Attorney, and on behalf of Kankakee County Sheriff Mike Downey; it names Governor JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as Defendants.  The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief based upon the Act violating the Illinois Constitution; violating the single-subject law; violating separation of powers; being unconstitutionally vague; and violating the three-readings requirement.  
“This lawsuit should not be necessary”, said State’s Attorney Jim Rowe, adding that “I surely believe that freedom should not hinge upon one’s ability to pay a bond, and that the criminal justice system is in dire need of reform, including bail and beyond.  However, regardless of whether you agree with or reject the many reforms of the Safe-T Act, or even how we may each interpret them, one thing is certain: you cannot amend the Illinois Constitution without a referendum or Constitutional Convention (Illinois Constitution, Article XIV).”  Indeed, every Amendment to the Illinois Constitution since 1974 has been accomplished by referendum vote of the people (the General Assembly’s own website speaks to this: https://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/conampro.htm). In fact, amendments to the current bail section of the Illinois Constitution (Article I, Section 9) were adopted by referendum vote of the people in 1982.  Most recently in 2014, voters approved amendments to the Victim’s Rights Act (Article 1, Section 8.1), also by referendum vote of the people.  In 2021, those voting Yes for HB3653 ignored this process and attempted to amend the Illinois Constitution by denying voters the right to decide and instead placing the decision unconstitutionally and solely in the hands of legislators.  
For instance, Article 1, Section 9 of our state Constitution specifically states that:
​‘All persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for the following offenses where the proof is evident or the presumption great: capital offenses; offenses for which a sentence of life imprisonment may be imposed as a consequence of conviction; and felony offenses for which a sentence of imprisonment, without conditional and revocable release, shall be imposed by law as a consequence of conviction, when the court, after a hearing, determines that release of the offender would pose a real and present threat to the physical safety of any person.’
“The Safe-T Act has effectively amended this section of the Illinois Constitution without a referendum vote of the people.  The Legislature does not have that power.  This lawsuit and the Illinois Constitution beg our legislators to do what is right and follow the process: give the people their right to vote,” said Rowe.
Sheriff Mike Downey noted that “from the day HB3653 was signed into law, law enforcement sounded the alarm about how dangerous this legislation would be to law abiding citizens throughout Illinois.  Unfortunately, that alarm has fallen upon deaf ears in Springfield.  This lawsuit aims to correct these concerns and to simply ensure the process is done in the light of day and in accordance with the Illinois Constitution.”
In addition to the Safe-T Act’s violation of Articles I and XIV of the Illinois Constitution, the Act also violates the single-subject law (Article IV, Section 8(d)) where it is over 750 pages, amends no fewer than 260 statutes, and touches many clearly distinct subjects, including policing and criminal law, labor relations, redistricting, elections, grants the Attorney General increased powers, and amends whistleblower laws.  Pursuant to People v. Reedy, 295 Ill. App. 3d 34, 42 (1999), “a public act that violates the single subject rule is not severable, rather the entire Act is unconstitutional and thus void”.
Further, Article IV Section 8(d) of the Illinois Constitution requires that every bill “shall be read by title on three different days in each house.”  This applies not only to the original bill, but to amendments when they represent a substantial departure from the original bill.  Oddly, at its 1st Reading HB3653 was a 7-page bill to address a mere single statute governing the return of property to inmates upon their release from prison (730 ILCS 5/3-14-1).  By the time it was delivered to Senators at 4:30am on January 13, 2021, it had grown 100-fold to over 750 pages and touched 260+ statutes.  The 2nd and 3rd Readings were held on the same day, and the votes were cast in both the Senate and House on the same day.  This process clearly violates the ‘Three Readings Rule’ of the Illinois Constitution.
The Illinois Constitution guarantees the voters a voice in this process.  For these reasons and others articulated in the lawsuit, we turn to the Illinois Courts for a remedy and encourage the Illinois Legislature to correct the process and give the people their right to vote.  I also encourage all citizens of Illinois to read for themselves the Act and those authorities cited in this release. It is a lengthy read, no doubt, but you should read it for yourself so you can fully comprehend its breadth and impact.  The importance of this issue is worth the investment of your time.
It gives this Office no joy to file this lawsuit and I do so with some trepidation, well aware of how it may be responded to by those in powerful positions; just know that we welcome criminal justice reform done properly at the will of the people, and we pray that can still be accomplished.

**HERZLIYA, Israel, July 08, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Safe-T Group Ltd.** **(Nasdaq: SFET) (TASE: SFET) (“Safe-T” or the “Company”),** a global provider of cyber-security and privacy solutions for consumers and enterprises, today announced its entrance into the home computer market with the release of its first consumer privacy solution designed for Windows personal computers (“PCs”).

Building upon the success and best-of-breed technology of its iOS privacy solution currently helping protect thousands of mobile devices, Safe-T is expanding its offerings into the global Windows PC market. Today, with approximately 50% of worldwide data traffic originating from desktop/laptop devices1 and with over 40% of global consumers having already become victims of online identity theft2, the need for ensuring privacy when browsing from home is more critical than ever.

“Today, our privacy and personal data is increasingly at risk which is why it is important for us to provide our users with comprehensive protection for their desktop computers as well as their mobile iOS devices. We are proud to announce the release of our consumer privacy solution for Windows desktops, a strategic development that enables us to address a large global opportunity by expanding our offerings into the consumer home market,” said Shachar Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Safe-T. “We intend to leverage the strong traction we are generating with our iOS mobile products as we further expand our portfolio into untapped market segments including other mobile and desktop platforms over the next few months.”

Utilizing advanced encryption technologies, the desktop privacy solution prevents a user’s personal data from being accessed or monitored by Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”), advertisers and third parties. By blocking the ability to track or monitor a user’s online activity and history, their personal information is protected when browsing from home or when using public Wi-Fi or other unsecured internet access points. With the consumer privacy for PCs, users can protect themselves from online attacks including identity and credit card theft.

**Strategic Investor was Granted the Opportunity to Participate in the Company’s Growth Through Additional Future Funding at Premium Valuations**

**HERZLIYA, Israel, Aug. 10, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Safe-T Group Ltd. (Nasdaq: SFET) (TASE: SFET) (“Safe-T” or the “Company”),** a global provider of cybersecurity and privacy solutions for consumers and enterprises, today announced the closing of a non-dilutive strategic funding agreement of up to $4,000,000 to support the further growth of its consumer privacy solutions and its customer acquisition program.

Under the terms of the agreement, O.R.B. Spring Ltd. (“O.R.B.”) will provide the Company with an upfront cash commitment of $2,000,000 with an additional $2,000,000 available subject to achievement of certain milestones. The funding, made through a series of cash installments until July 2023, will be allocated specifically towards Safe-T’s customer acquisition program for one of its consumer privacy solutions. O.R.B. is controlled by Barak Avitbul, an accomplished technology industry entrepreneur and leader and the founder and former CEO of the Company’s enterprise privacy business subsidiary, NetNut Ltd.

“This strategic funding of up to $4 million enables us to invest into our consumer privacy customer acquisition program and grow our business. Considering current market conditions, this deal structure is much more efficient for the Company as it allows us to eliminate a material amount of transaction costs and fees without impacting our existing shareholders at current market valuations,” said Shachar Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Safe-T Group. “Importantly, we consider it a great privilege to have a former executive of our group making an investment in the Company by aligning his financial interests with those of the Company. This is a sign of commitment and confidence in our offering and business model, as well as in our team.”  


The Company will repay the funding using a revenue share model that is based on sales generated only from customers of the new consumer privacy solution acquired with each funding installment. Each such funding installment shall be repaid within two years and if the repayments do not reach 100% of the installments, then the Company will cover the remaining amounts in cash or shares, at the Company’s sole discretion. Once the investment amount has been repaid in full, Safe-T and O.R.B shall share the attributed revenue of the consumer privacy solution in equal parts (50:50) until the lapse of five years after the date on which each installment was received by the Company.  


In addition, the investor was granted an opportunity to make additional investments in the Company through a series of warrants enabling him to increase his future interest in Safe-T’s businesses, including the attractive consumer privacy market. The warrants will be exercisable at prices reflecting premiums ranging from approximately 130% to 300% of the current share price, for periods of up to 3 years from the vesting dates of the warrants. Upon potential exercise of all granted warrants, the Company may receive additional aggregate gross proceeds of between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000, based upon the amount of additional funding provided.

The Company shall have the right to require the exercise of all or any portion of the warrants if the closing price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares exceeds 150% of the respective exercise price of each series of warrants for three consecutive trading days.

(Nasdaq: SFET) (TASE: SFET) (“Safe-T” or the “Company”), a global provider of cyber-security and privacy solutions to consumers and enterprises, today announced record financial results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022. 

Key highlights for the six months ended June 30, 2022:

* Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2022 reached a record high of $8,798,000, an increase of 181% compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2021. In the three months ended June 30, 2022, revenues totaled a record of $4,777,000, an increase of 168% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021.
* Gross profit for the six-month period ended June 30, 2022 amounted to $4,733,000, an increase of 279% compared to the corresponding period in 2021. For the three-month period ended June 30, 2022,gross profit amounted to $2,616,000, an increase of $225% compared to the corresponding period in 2021.
* Operating expense reduction efforts resulted in a 33% decrease in net loss in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022 (25% on a non-IFRS basis). Ongoing expense reduction efforts are expected to drive improved operational results in the third quarter of 2022.
* The Company's privacy enterprises business reached break-even operating results (excluding recently eliminated legal expenses).

“The financial results of the first half of 2022 reflect how effectively we continued to execute our strategy with diversified businesses into the large cybersecurity and privacy markets. We continue to drive significant and sustainable revenue growth while efficiently executing ongoing cost reduction efforts. During May and August, we secured a $2 million non-dilutive credit line facility from a leading Israeli bank and a strategic financing of up to $4 million, which may lead to potential future funding at premium valuations for the Company. Supporting our current level of growth requires investment into our consumer products and into acquiring new customers, and we are extremely proud to have secured additional funding through creative financing initiatives that support the Company’s growth well into 2023, without impacting our shareholders at current market valuations. We believe these achievements are a strong validation of our business model and the long-term potential of Safe-T,” said Shachar Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Safe-T.

Led by a former CEO of the Company’s enterprise privacy business subsidiary, this investment features a unique structure to protect shareholders from near-term dilution and is based on a revenue share model on newly acquired customers. The investor is also incentivized to provide additional funding through warrants exercisable at premiums ranging from 135% to 300% of the closing share price at the date of the agreement. The cash available under these financing initiatives, aggregating up to more than $5 million, is in addition to the $4.04 million cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022.
* *Product* *Development* *and Offering*: In July, the Company introduced two new products as it further penetrates the global consumer market. Safe-T launched its privacy solution for Windows, allowing it to enter the large desktop computer market with its first product and introduced its privacy solution for Android mobile devices. With these launches, Safe-T can now serve customers across all major hardware platforms including mobile devices running Apple iOS, Android, and personal computers.

“Our strong first half results reinforce our confidence in the prospects and outlook for our business, as our growth strategy continues to build momentum. In the second half of 2022, our team’s focus will be on further building upon the strength of our cybersecurity and privacy business by leveraging the recent funding and our new products to drive additional growth. Over the past four quarters, our Apple iOS offerings have driven continuous record growth. Through the strategic expansion of our consumer portfolio with new solutions for the large, untapped desktop computer and Android markets, Safe-T is now positioned to capitalize on exciting new revenue opportunities. We remain firmly focused on our cost reduction plan, improving the efficiency of the business and together with our new products and investments into our customer acquisition program, we expect to not only drive significant additional revenue growth, but deliver improved financial performance in the months ahead,” concluded Mr. Daniel.

*Financial Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022:*

* Total revenues amounted to $4,777,000 (Q2.2021: $1,784,000). The growth is attributed to the increase in enterprise privacy business revenues and the consolidation of CyberKick’s revenues following the completion of its acquisition on July 4, 2021.
* Cost of revenues totaled $2,161,000 (Q2.2021: $979,000). The increase is mainly a result of the consolidation of CyberKick’s cost of revenues, mainly in traffic acquisition costs for third party products.
* Research and development expenses totaled $889,000 (Q2.2021: $781,000). The increase is attributed to the consolidation of CyberKick’s research and development expenses and the development of new products, partially offset by a reduction in research and development expenses of the enterprise security segment, due to the Company’s previously announced agreement with TerraZone Ltd.
* Sales and marketing expenses totaled $2,624,000 (Q2.2021: $1,308,000). The increase is mainly attributed to the consolidation of CyberKick’s sales and marketing expenses, primarily its media costs, partially offset by a reduction in the sales and marketing expenses of the enterprise security segment, due to the agreement with TerraZone Ltd.
* General and administrative expenses totaled $1,998,000 (Q2.2021: $1,488,000). The increase is mainly due to higher professional fees, predominantly legal, in connection with patent-related proceedings brought by and against Bright Data Ltd., which were resolved by settlement on May 17, 2022.
* IFRS net loss totaled $3,158,000, or $0.10 basic loss per ordinary share (Q2.2021: net loss of $2,370,000, or $0.09 basic loss per ordinary share).
* Non-IFRS net loss totaled $2,523,000, or $0.08 basic loss per ordinary share (Q2.2021: loss of $2,174,000, or $0.08 basic loss per ordinary share).

* Total revenues amounted to $8,798,000 (H1.2021: $3,131,000). The growth is attributed to the increase in enterprise privacy business revenues and the consolidation of CyberKick’s revenues following the completion of its acquisition on July 4, 2021.

* Sales and marketing expenses totaled $5,658,000 (H1.2021: $2,430,000). The increase is primarily attributed to the consolidation of CyberKick’s sales and marketing expenses, primarily its media costs, partially offset by a reduction in the sales and marketing expenses of the enterprise security segment, due to the agreement with TerraZone Ltd.
* General and administrative expenses totaled $4,249,000 (H1.2021: $2,588,000).

> Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema faced fresh backlash from civil rights groups on Wednesday after the Republican governor of her home state of Arizona signed into law a bill that could purge hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls.

> Advocacy organizations argued the state-level GOP measure was able to advance because Sinema and fellow right-wing Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin joined with Republicans earlier this year to tank a proposed change to the Senate filibuster, an archaic rule standing in the way of federal voting rights legislation that would prohibit voter purges and other suppression tactics.

> Harvey warned that the new Arizona law, known as H.B. 2492, &quot;threatens to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Arizona voters and silence the voices of older, minority, and low-income voters in particular.

> One of more than 250 voter suppression bills that Republican legislatures across the U.S. are pursuing, H.B. 2492 requires state residents-including those already registered to vote-to provide documentary proof of citizenship remain eligible to cast a ballot in state and federal elections in Arizona.

> Democracy Docket explained that prior to the passage of H.B. 2492, Arizona voters who registered using state forms were required to provide proof of citizenship, but voters who registered using federal forms under the National Voter Registration Act did not, and were allowed to vote in federal elections held in the state.

> &quot;If officials are unable to verify citizenship, the voter will not be allowed to register or vote until they provide documentary proof.

Some nifty tidbits found there:

* It confirms what weapons are off-limits for Purgers: ""weapons of mass destruction, fragment-producing explosives higher than a hazard class HC/D 1.4 and viral contagion projectiles.""

* It says government officials ""of ranking 5 and higher"" are off-limits. This is a bit different from what they announce immediately before the beginning of each Purge Period b/c those say ""ranking 10 and higher"", but the distinction is moot unless or until they spell out who's rank 5 and who's rank 10 & so on.

* there's also this: ""Non-compliance with any of the above rules will result in death by hanging."" So there can be no ""sanctuary cities"" that choose to ignore the Purge Period and provide police and EMS services as usual on Purge Night.

v4i59v,t2_3dx6nj92,"[The Purge] Immigration LawHow does the Purge affect immigration law?

1. If I cross the U.S. border illegally during the Purge, technically I committed no crime. Do I get a green card the next day?
2. If I commit marriage fraud, and marry an immigrant in exchange for citizenship on Purge Day, does she get the green card as if the marriage was all on the up and up? Do I have to divorce her before the Purge ends, or can we wait until she gets her green card? Also, does she have to pay me that day, or does it only matter that the marriage happened on the Purge Day?
3. Piggybacking on a previous question, if I marry multiple women (and men) on Purge Day, do they all get green cards, or can only one person get a green card?
4. Final point, let us say I perform a bunch of marriages, in spite of not being an ordained minister, a judge or a boat captain. During the Purge Day, I call myself a judge. (Thus, criminal impersonation.) Naturally, I can't be prosecuted, since all crime is legal. But are the marriages I perform valid? And, going back to the above questions, could I say, perform a lot of marriage fraud, thus getting a lot of immigrants green cards?",-0.9351,negative,2022-06-04 00:35:14,Purge Law,not-misinfo,reddit

*****
> Conservative activists have seized on that power to attempt to remove thousands of voters from the rolls with just weeks to go before the October 17 start of in-person early voting in this battleground state.

> Ahead of voting starting in those and other races, voter challenges have cropped up in at least nine counties - including Fulton, Cobb and DeKalb in the metro Atlanta area and Chatham, home to Savannah, according to the New Georgia Project, a voting rights group that&#039;s tracking the developments.

> While election officials in other states have reported voter challenges, the biggest number appears to have been lodged in Georgia.

> In some cases, they have used commercially available bulk change-of-address data and compared it to the county voter rolls to argue that some voters have moved and no longer qualify to cast ballots in Georgia.

> The 1993 National Voter Registration Act prohibits systematic purges of the voting rolls within 90 days of a federal election.

> Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said election officials already have procedures in place to clean up the voter rolls - without having the added job of researching challenges brought by citizen activists.

h054kf,t2_16rurb,"[SECRET] RJG PurgesThe Iraqi government has recieved a list of individuals that were once under IRGC payroll. While the individuals affiliated with moderate parties, if there are any, will be spared, those involved in the formation of private militias and still holding power in Iraq will be purged. Law 241 has been proposed seeking to purge Iraqi politics of foreign interference by terrorist non-state actors. The RJG has shown its ugly face and can no longer be considered a friend to Iraq.

Earlier this week, the leaders of Asaib Ahl al Haq and other groups within the Fatah Alliance were arrested in Iraq, with the only armed Shia Islamist groups remaining being the Sadrists within the national guard and Kataib Hezbollah's units deployed to Lebanon (soon to return following the political settlement) and Syria. Without centralized leadership and lacking  funding from Iran, these groups will soon collapse as many merely joined these organizations as a means to seek employment in poor economic conditions. 

The Qutr Party has attempted during its short rule to consolidate power, remove the IRGC's presence from Iraq, and build a more tolerant secular society, by Arab standards at least. *""The Iraqi people are a Muslim Arabic speaking people. The Iraqi government will not interfere in people's right to, or right not to, practice. 'There is no compulsion in religion.'(2:256)""* is a phrase frequently repeated by Qutrists. While attempts to strengthen the public sector by allowing over 1 million Sunnis to return to their jobs have failed, other campaigns such secret attempts to stack the army with far more competent ex-Baathist officials and deep-state propaganda operations against Islamism in Iraq proved to be far more fruitful. Following this policy of covert subversion of political Islam in Iraq, the Qutr Party has set its sights on two targets; The remaining Shiite Militias in Iraq, and the seminaries.

**Iraqi Deep State**

The Iraqi General Intelligence Directorate will utilize the list obtained from Iran to purge its ranks of RJG aligned individuals, with Qutrist candidates being placed in positions of power and any sectarian elements slowly being dismissed and put on paid leave or retirement. The purge of the deep state will allow Iraqi intelligence to perform more operations that are in line with the government and the general public's interests, not just the interests of one aspect of society.

**Military Purges**

50,000 of the 300,000 strong Iraqi Armed Forces are made up of pre-Qutrist  forces that may harbor pro-IRGC elements. They will be closely monitored for any affiliation with the RJG before the terrorist attack will be forced into retirement with a pension. Those found potentially complicit in the attacks will be arrested and will be replaced by Qutr and Baath loyalists.


**Purging the Shiite Militias of RJG Influence**

It is no secret that the Qutr Party's policy of religious pluralism conflicts with many of the militias' ideology of Political Islam. The Qutr Party had during the Khomeini days carefully balanced the interests of its constituents with the interests of the Shia clerics, namely through the friendly Ali Sistani and Saairun ally Moqtada Al-Sadr. By carefully navigating the political landscape, several reform laws were passed without deeply offending the Shia clerics which dominate Iraqi political discourse. The fall of the Islamic republic changed this dynamic entirely with entire militias becoming de-funded and various leaders arrested for corrupt dealings with the IRGC.

The remaining militias could prove useful to Iraq's foreign policy goals and it has a vested interest in controlling what remains of the militant Shiite movement. As such, it will launch Operation Tashaiyuh, an operation by the general intelligence directorate to place Qutr government loyalists who are Shiites at the helm of these organizations while quietly eroding the influence of the now penniless Milita leaders through a combination of arrests/discrediting and forced retirement from the PMF National Guard.


**Controlling the Seminaries**

The Religious Seminaries of Najaf and Karbala are extremely powerful in Post-2003 Iraq, with many religious Shiites taking the word of the various Marja's as law. Without the Grand Ayatollah in Iran, the Marja's are now more free to make their own judgements on jursipundence and politics. The GiD will work to place individuals aligned with Sistani in positions of power within Najaf and Karbala all while Sistani receives a healthy paycheck to replace his Iranian one for cooperating with the government in promoting coexistence and tolerance and refraining from interfering with politics.

Several agents posing as scholars shall also infiltrate the seminaries to identify any source of unrest, to have any unruly clerics swept away in the cover of night should they promote violence against the state or any of its ethnic groups. This will prove to be quite controversial if it gets out. (if both secrecy and success fail badly)",0.9065,positive,2020-06-10 01:17:43,Purge Law,not-misinfo,reddit

11j2fj1,t2_6xa1kwkw,"Brothers/sisters in Christ. I am terrified. At the self-identified US Christian values party's CPAC conference, calls for genocide: ""transgenderism must be eradicated"". US Conservative Christians voting GOP, I beg you: is this enough that you turn against your party and protect LGBT people?*Caríssimi fratres et soróres mei in Xristo.* My dearest beloved brothers and sisters in Christ: a more personal message to y'all than I've posted here before:

I'm truly terrified now. The party which many doctrinally-traditionalist Christians in the US support has held their CPAC conference, where a political commentator named Michael Knowles has essentially called for open genocide against transgender people, met with applause. In his words:

>transgenderism must be **eradicated** from public life.

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-knowles-calls-for-eradication-of-transgender-people-at-conservative-political-action-conference](https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-knowles-calls-for-eradication-of-transgender-people-at-conservative-political-action-conference)

Conservative Christians who currently side with the Republican Party due to agreeing with their morals, will you please come to our aid and renounce the party should they attempt something like this? Maybe write to or call on your elected GOP officials to turn away from hatred and violence, and affirm the right to life for all citizens?

This Christian nationalist threat targeting the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the US has honestly kept me up at night. I got 6 hrs sleep the night before, and 5 1/2 hrs last night, awake, haunted by thinking about what someone like Pres. Ron DeSantis could do to us. And while I might've doubted myself before as being over anxious, that changed till last night at around 6:00 when I opened the Reddit feed and the headline above was trending. This has skyrocketed my anxiety; they, the party *have* now basically called for eliminating/killing people. I still feel that we are on the brink of a catastrophe: lapse into theocratic dictatorship, with Nuremberg laws slowly coming along leading to rounding up dissidents and 'degenerates', dragging LGBTQ+ adults and children out on to the street screaming to be executed by firing squad, then civil war, which all who don't leave will have to fight in. They say we're ""coming for their kids"" but they are coming for our kids. Each passing day I become more convinced that LGBTQ+ people *are indeed in the position of the Jews in the 1930s.* They want us gone.

I do worry greatly for myself, but to share a bit about who I am, there's not as great of a threat to me personally; while I identify as part of the LGBTQ community, I'm only gender questioning---I haven't transitioned or changed my name---and identify as what we call genderqueer/nonbinary, perhaps 'femboy', for now... Although, the seemingly now fading desire remains with me that my dysphoria could worsen later and motivate that I transition. But for now I personally can stay safe as long as I stay closeted, restricted to wearing dresses in my room like as I was writing this, and frankly this is threat a very good reason to stay that way.

But most of all I worry for my colleague in grad school, who is the only trans woman whom I know in real life. She is beautiful, she fights for good and is admirable and I look up to her, even though I suspect we may not actually agree on certain things politically (I being center-left socdem and she appearing far-left---hopefully anarchist or libcom, not tankie, but that doesn't matter right now.) She must be even more terrified than me at the moment. I don't want to lose her... I worry about the trans people whom I talk with here on Reddit and elsewhere online: gazing at people's pictures on trans subs could become haunting, thinking about the possibility that everyone in them might end up dead or imprisoned after 2024.

In conclusion, I call on conservative American Christians who have/are supporting the Republican Party: although we may have differences in doctrine, I being a progressive Christian, we still affirm the truth of the inherent sanctity of the lives of LGBTQ+ people, that gay, bi, trans and queer people deserve not that they be 'eradicated' ever, regardless of anyone's supposed sin. **And therefore, that conservative Christians may establish personal red-lines regarding acceptable policy which may not be crossed---no laws harming and ruining the lives of LGBTQ+ people. Write letters to or call the offices of your local GOP reps, senators, Speaker McCarthy, that you will not support the party any longe---tell Gov. DeSantis you wouldn't support his candidacy in '24--should they allow anyone of their own to do something like this media figure at CPAC has called them to do.** I know that abortion is a big deal to you; I know you perhaps can't bring yourself to vote for Democrats, or even 3rd parties, which is why the chance to change your own and purge the GOP of wrath and threats to others. Because to protect even your neighbors (and I understand, we're different and 'weird' to you) who are LGBTQ+ or non-Christian, thus ""living in sin"" according to your interpretation of doctrine, **is pro-life.**

> The Commission to Examine Racial Inequity in Virginia Law is a group of lawyers, judges and law professors chaired by Cynthia Hudson, the state&#039;s former chief deputy attorney general.

> University of Virginia law students worked on the research and drafting that formed the basis of the report, and commissioners arrived at policy recommendations through majority votes after taking public comments and suggestions from advocacy groups.

> &quot;Schools in Virginia are increasingly isolated by race and socioeconomic status, with the number of highly-segregated, high-poverty schools nearly doubling in the last twenty years,&quot; the report said.

This one is coming up on the agenda in the OKLEG Senate Judiciary committee today (2/28/23)

The ability to pay bail is often what keeps individuals detained in jails while awaiting due process, and if you've read any stories about people dying in our county jails (many of which are in poor conditions in general or have political conflicts of interest or corruption issues^see: ^Turnkey ^Health ), some of them are folks who were not able to bond out or have someone bond them out, even if they were not a violent threat in the first place. 

Cash bail systems often keep those without money in jail and those with plenty of money about to buy their way out, and more areas in the country are ending this practice for nonviolent offenses. 

* https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeseq/2021/10/01/money-bail-is-unjust-and-should-end/?sh=260b89516f06


>The money bail system in the United States criminalizes poverty, destroys lives, and wastes public resources while failing to make us safer. For this reason, several states and cities around the country are reducing or ending their use of money bail. More should.

>Polls have found that most people favor ending the practice of jailing people who cannot afford money bail before trial in all but extreme cases. This position is not just humane—it’s also fiscally responsible. The United States spends an estimated $22.2 billion annually to detain people in jails, and money bail is a major driver of this mass incarceration. And this is not just a problem in major cities. Since 1970, rural pretrial incarceration has grown more than 400 percent.

>More than 60 percent of the people who sit in jail at any given time have not even been convicted of crimes. They simply can’t afford to buy their freedom. Many people have heard the story of Kaleif Browder, the teenager from the Bronx who was accused of stealing a backpack and forced to await trial on Rikers Island because he could not afford bail. Unlike many people in that situation, he refused to plead guilty to a crime he maintained he did not commit and spent three years behind bars, including two in solitary confinement. Although he was eventually released, the experience left him deeply scarred. He died by suicide in 2015. There are stories like Kaleif’s in every court system where wealth is still allowed to determine whether a person awaits trial behind bars.

>Money bail allows poor people who are charged with minor crimes to face indefinite incarceration, while rich people who are accused of the same offenses, or worse, are released simply because they have the funds to buy their freedom.



* https://stoprecidivism.org/blog/why-are-more-states-than-ever-passing-laws-for-no-cash-bail-and-pretrial-detention/

>A primary reason many states who have made changes to their cash bail system have cited as why they have done so is because of the clogging up of their jails. Across our nation, states and federal systems are struggling to find space for all the incoming individuals being incarcerated.

>According to the Prison Policy Initiative, more than 500,000 people in the United States were detained in jails before their trial in 2018. New Jersey was one of the first states to reform their cash bail system. In their first year with the new system in place, their pretrial jail population fell by 20 percent.



Here is a link about NPR doing away with cash bail as a state re: the PreTrial Fairness Act -

* https://www.npr.org/2022/12/28/1145763929/illinois-will-become-the-first-state-to-do-away-with-cash-bail

>If a defendant is facing a lower-level nonviolent charge, they will no longer have to pay a cash bail to be released from jail while they await trial. But a judge can still hold the defendant if they prove to be a flight risk or a danger to the community. Governor JB Pritzker says this reform is for the single mom who commits shoplifting but is stuck in jail because she can't afford her way out.


The Pretrial Fairness Act was opposed by (no surprise here) police and prosecutors -

And another link studying bail reforms, in Harris County, Texas - 

* https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/15050-bail-reform-benefits

>“We looked at this particular reform because it got national attention when it occurred in 2017, and, in my view, is actually politically feasible in many places,” said Heaton. “We show that it’s possible to change the pretrial system and release more people in a way that benefits the general public, helps defendants, and doesn’t lead to more crime. Harris County provides an example of that.”

-----
-----

TLDR --- the bill proposed by Rogers if passed into law makes a reform like the elimination of cash bail for minor offenses much more difficult.  This comes at a time as Oklahoma consistently sees deaths in our county jails, where people have not been actually convicted of a crime but are being detained while awaiting trial, and for some cases, it is not even known to their loved ones they are there due to the timeliness (or lack thereof) of how arrests records are published and smaller county law enforcement operates.",-0.9947,negative,2023-02-28 07:16:46,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

xrgq08,t2_12w1i7,"Pregnant Workers Fairness ActI've seen some renewed interest in pushing Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 1065). Since workplace discrimination is a regular topic here, I thought it might be of interest to some of us.  


Currently, a person with a disability caused by pregnancy is covered by the ADA; however, employers don't always feel that pregnancy itself counts as a ""disability."" As a result, many people who are pregnant are denied reasonable accommodations that would otherwise be offered and guaranteed under the ADA. Employees in those situations are forced to either work in conditions unsafe for pregnancy (e.g. lifting heavy weights, working without water), or be forced into unpaid leave.  


The goal of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is to extend/clarify the rights for a reasonable accommodation to people who are pregnant. It would also allow people who are pregnant to take legal action against employers who fail to offer reasonable accommodations for pregnancy. 

This bill passed the House in 2021, and appears to have bipartisan support in the Senate so it is likely to pass there too if it is brought for a vote. Several similar bills have passed in other states, including some that are traditionally not friendly towards workers.

m0p5r1,t2_9n0xyun6,"BREAKING: Jacob Chansley, aka the Q Shaman, will remain in jail pretrial, a federal judge has ruled. The decision by Judge Royce Lamberth followed a hearing last week where Chansley tried to argue he acted non-violently and was following Trump's orders.• Judge's opinion document [here.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20507832/3-8-21-jacob-chansley-opinion.pdf) Judge Lambert just tore these people apart into shreds.

• ""The court finds that a six-foot police w/a metal spearhead fixed to the top is, undoubtedly, a dangerous weapon.""

• When the Q Shaman's mom told ""60 Minutes"" that her son was ""innocently sitting in a prison cell,"" it did not exactly help his attempt to be released into her custody.

• The ""60 Minutes"" interview backfired on these bozos in a huge way:

>The issue, then, is not that defense counsel cannot confidentially communicate with his client. The issue is that when defense counsel is able to speak with his client, he squanders the opportunity for private conversations, preferring instead to conduct a public interview. Such media appearances are undoubtedly conducive to defense counsel’s fame. But they are not at all conducive to an argument that the only way defense counsel could privately communicate with his client is if defendant were temporarily released. Given defense counsel’s decision to use what could have been a confidential videoconference on a media publicity stunt, that argument is so frivolous as to insult the Court’s intelligence. For these reasons, the Court finds that defendant has not met his burden of establishing a “compelling reason” necessitating his temporary release. 18 U.S.C. §3142(i).

• Mama Chansely shooting her mouth off in the ""60 Minutes"" was another hugely bad move:

>January 6th reveal defendant’s current state of mind and willingness to break the law. Finally, defendant’s plan to return to his mother’s house would not mitigate his risk of flight. In the March 4, 2021 interview with 60 Minutes+, defendant’s mother repeatedly stated that her son did nothing wrong on January 6th. 60 Minutes+ Interview, supra at 13:23-13:40, 17:40-17:52. Instead, she said, her son merely “walked through open doors” and was “escorted into the Senate.” Id. Defendant’s mother further stated that she believes defendant to be “innocently sitting in a prison cell.” Id. at 17:44. The Court is not persuaded that defendant’s mother will ensure his compliance with any conditions of release imposed, and defendant identifies no other custodian

But Barry Loudermilk of Georgia is my representative and voted against the Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act and I wrote him today. No bad language. Here's the text of it. (How did I do?)Dear Mr. Loudermilk -

&#x200B;

I want to let you know how very disappointed I am by your vote against The Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act. As far as I can tell, you are the only Georgia representative to vote against this attempt to address the great corruption in the way our stock markets operate and I am baffled as to what your possible reasons could be. I know that the bill did pass the House and will probably not pass the Senate, but what could that matter to you? You had one chance to represent the so called ""Retail Investors"" of our country with your vote and you did not do it. This matters a great deal to me and I wanted to tell you so. 

&#x200B;

I am just one citizen and I am not a very political person. But I do have a great love of the United States and I believe that the big banks and hedge funds who have corrupted the way our stock markets are being run to such a disastrous degree will need to be reined in one day. It's a pity you have chosen to be against something which is so obviously needed. Anyway, i doubt if you will care  very much about the concerns I've expressed here or even if you will ever read this far down into my message. You are a member of Congress and I am simply a citizen. But I want you to know if you do happen to read down this far that I will never forget your failure to act when the people needed you to do it. I will vote for anyone who runs against you and it will not matter very much to me which party that other candidate is from. I will also share my opinions with my family and friends who are also resident in your district and do my very best to persuade them to act the same way at the next election.

The source for how each Rep on the Financial Services Committee voted: [https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210728/113999/CRPT-117-BA00-Vote006-20210728.pdf](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210728/113999/CRPT-117-BA00-Vote006-20210728.pdf)

The proposed bill is GOOD for retail investors and aims to equal the playing field, something the powers-that-be want no part in. For this, **I focused on campaign contributors that in my opinion benefit from the current unequal market structure that exists now**. This **only scrapes the surface** and only deals with contributors to each Rep's Campaign Committee and not their Leadership PACs. I only looked at the **Top 20 for each** as this took a while as is. The following data comes from [opensecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org) which is a great resource to track political funding. This is by no means comprehensive and is for only the **2020 election cycle**.

Sorry that some got out of order, but there was a lot of merging of images and it was time consuming as is.

For each screenshot, the columns are as follows:

hm8g2k,t2_2wkus,"Official or Not, It's Clear Pretrial Publicly Deprived Avery of His Right to a Fair TrialA couple of weeks ago, TickTock posted this study published on Cornell Law School's website on the impact of Kratz's infamous presser:

https://courses2.cit.cornell.edu/sociallaw/MakingAMurderer/PretrialPublicity.html

I noticed that a fair number of commenters criticized that post for overselling it as an ""official"" position of the law school, but I didn't see anyone actually dispute its contents.

It left me wondering...can anyone really dispute at this point that Kratz's press conference deprived Avery of his right to a fair trial? 

I want to focus on a few sections of the link in particular. Namely:

> This is consistent with the study by Ruva, Guenther, and Yarbrough that found that jurors who were exposed to negative pre-trial publicity were significantly more likely to vote guilty. This is also consistent with the study by the Department of Psychology at the University of South Florida which found that although jurors received jury instructions telling them not to discuss PTP, jurors often discussed it anyways

Personally I thought the idea that pretrial publicity affects outcomes and that jurors talk to each other about it to be pretty obvious, but it's always good to have actual studies backing the point. Now that this argument is backed with actual evidence, I don't see how it can be ignored.

Note that the Avery case seemed to be particularly big news in Manitowoc County and Kratz's press conference was especially dramatic -- so there's good reason to believe the effect was even greater than the average case studied.

But why speculate when we have proof? Here's the other section of the link I'd like to focus on:

> When one juror was asked why they voted guilty and what they thought had happened to Halbach, the juror replied “[t]orture and rape. Then he shot her in the head. He cut her up and put her in a burn barrel.”

Please recall that Kratz's presser put a very strong emphasis on the torture/rape angle but all the jury heard was evidence of the alleged murder. This is extremely strong evidence that at least one juror was unduly influenced by the press conference.

In short, the full weight of the evidence shows that the press conference outside of trial made a statistically significant change to Avery's chances in trial. Additionally we have direct and clear evidence that the press conference did in fact influence the jury.

Here are some possible objections I anticipate:

1. *Avery was obviously guilty and would have been convicted anyway*. This is what a fair trial is supposed to determine. This argument isn't an argument that he received a fair trial, it's an argument that ""obviously guilty"" people don't need to get one.

2. *This wasn't reversed on appeal.* Every court system claims to be fair. I hope I do not have to explain the problems with assuming a court system is fair simply because the court system itself claims to be.

3. *Jury selection solved this issue.* All case with jurors have jury selection. Jury selection in Avery's case does not distinguish it from other cases in the study that showed pretrial publicity negatively affects outcomes.

4. *Avery could have changed venues.* Remember, you have a right to a fair trial AND a right to a jury of your peers. It's not an either/or scenario. You're supposed to get all your rights. A violation of one right can't be justified by saying they could have given up a different right instead.

5. *There is no good remedy for this kind of pretrial publicity.* Maybe, maybe not. But you can't start talking about remedies without first acknowledging there is in fact a problem that needs to be remedied.

To conclude, how can anyone reasonably disagree that Avery did not receive a fair trial?",-0.9722,negative,2020-07-06 09:17:27,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/business/us-trade-counterfeit-china.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/business/us-trade-counterfeit-china.html)

*  The Biden administration on Thursday added WeChat’s e-commerce ecosystem  and AliExpress, an e-commerce site owned by Alibaba, to [an annual list of markets](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2021%20Notorious%20Markets%20List.pdf) that the United States says engage in counterfeiting and copyright violations. 
* [https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2021%20Notorious%20Markets%20List.pdf](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2021%20Notorious%20Markets%20List.pdf)

2) Raise a potential solution (as seen in NY times article) on changing the de Minimis limit. Currently anything less then $800 and on country specific schedules are DUTY FREE. 

* One provision, proposed by Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat  of Oregon, would raise the threshold for the dollar value of a good that  could come into the United States duty free from certain countries,  namely China.
* That level, called de minimis, is set at $800 in the  United States. That’s far above the level in many other countries, a  policy that critics say has led to an explosion of imported e-commerce  packages, including some unsafe and illicit goods.
* Blumenauer’s bill offers a helpful solution. And House Democrats have already [included](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairman-neal-touts-trade-title-china-competition-bill) it in the new America COMPETES Act of 2022, which is intended to address key problems in the U.S.-China trading relationship.  

3) The gov needs revenue and this is low hanging fruit

* [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-record-1-trillion-trade-deficit-doesnt-even-count-hundreds-of-millions-of-small-packages-mailed-directly-from-china-11643654834](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-record-1-trillion-trade-deficit-doesnt-even-count-hundreds-of-millions-of-small-packages-mailed-directly-from-china-11643654834)
*  The huge volume of these de minimis shipments means the U.S. Treasury lost out on roughly $20 billion in tariff revenues.  
*  It’s commonly estimated that each billion dollars of goods imports costs [6,000](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/fact-sheets/2011/october/trade-agreements-and-jobs) U.S. jobs. As a result, de minimis robbed Americans of some 768,000 jobs last year.  
*  Combat lost domestic manufacturing, increased intellectual property theft from  unregulated imports, and damage to bricks-and-mortar retailers competing  with importers. 

4) Biden supports the new America Competes Act of 2022

* [https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cdf14301-3330-496f-96af-f17d9e2e25a0](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cdf14301-3330-496f-96af-f17d9e2e25a0)
*  **The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology recently  voted to advance the America Competes Act of 2022 “the Act.” This comes  after the Senate passed its version of the bill, the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act, in June of 2021. The focus of the Act is to strengthen  America’s scientific and technological activities in the 21st Century,  in order to be able to compete with China in these critical fields in  the future. Along with having bi-partisan support, President Joe Biden  has expressed his support for the Act, “The House took an important step  forward in advancing legislation that will make our supply chains  stronger and reinvigorate the innovation engine of our economy to  outcompete China and the rest of the world for decades to come . . .  \[t\]ogether, we have an opportunity to show China and the rest of the  world that the 21st century will be the American century – forged by the  ingenuity and hard work of our innovators, workers, and businesses. “**

* The house has already passed and now it's at the senate

5) If the America Competes Act is passed, there will be MAJOR impact to Alibaba

&#x200B;

* The America competes act includes an ""Import Security and Fairness section"" that when passed
*  **Prohibit imports from countries that are both (1) identified as  non-market economies and (2) included on the United States Trade  Representative’s Priority Watch List of countries that violate  intellectual property standards (i.e., China) from receiving de minimis  treatment.** This will ensure that certain countries are not taking  advantage of the de minimis provisions to avoid paying duties and taxes. 
*  Provide CBP with statutory authority to collect additional  information regarding all imports that receive de minimis treatment upon  importation. This should decrease the number of illicit and illegal  packages that enter the U.S. 
* **Prohibit importers that are suspended or  debarred from receiving de minimis treatment.**

TLDR Summary;

* **Every single one** of the politicians who voted against the Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act has received campaign contributions from some combination of hedge funds, big banks, ""family offices"" (another type of HF), or other investment group that benefits from the current market structure.
* Blackstone Group has their name all over these politicians.
* Bk2 Holdings is a weird shell ""dark money"" company linked to a billionaire HF manager and has their hand in a lot of these pools.
* UBS and Bank of America are other VERY COMMON names on these lists. Wells Fargo to a slightly lesser extent also.
* The **DTCC** and other clearinghouses are on some of these lists. Yes, that DTCC!!!!!
* Remember this is only the Reps on the Financial Services Committee who voted against this bill. The bill will at some point go to the House floor for a full vote. Call, email, tweet at, do everything to contact your Reps that may be on this list and request an answer to why they voted against a bill that goes against the best interests of their constituents. Demand answers!

edit 1: some of you have also pointed out that the **OCC (options clearing corp)** is also on this list, yikes!

edit 2: u/probablyannsaplant pointed out that you can use [opensecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org) to do the inverse and look at where, for example, Ken Griffin donated money. It really is a great tool for seeing the corruption that permeates the system.

edit 3: u/deal_ambitious made an excellent suggestion of cross referencing these institutions with those that fund the politicians who voted in favor. Summarized findings:

* Blackstone is common on the yes voters as well.
* The DTCC is actually **more commonly** found on the yes voters top 20 lists than the no voters.
* UBS is less common on yes voters, but still on some of their lists. Same with Wells Fargo
* Bank of America is **nowhere to be found** on the lists of yes voters! Nor is Bk2 Holdings.
* I want to re-emphasize that last point. **Bank of America is an extremely common donor to the No voters, and non-existent in the top 20 lists of yes voters. BK2 holdings as well**",0.9798,positive,2021-08-01 15:21:06,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

I also spoke with my personal mail lady and when I told her I was applying she asked my name and that she would tell her boss.  I guess they need people.  In fact, if I'm lucky enough to get hired I hope I can get hired at the station near my house.  Ok, so will an at-fault accident disqualify me, and will being on public assistance disqualify me?

Yes, I know voting is bullshit and so is the system it supports by the system exists, we have to deal with it, voting is free, and I have a LOT of free time on my hands.

When Biden came in they proposed a lot of power grabs that would have effectively created a one-party state: Adding two states, packing the Supreme Court with more justices, lowering the voting age, federalizing elections, etc. Luckily they didn't succeed in any of them. 

Lucky not only because I don't want to live in a dictatorship run by these dumb fucks, but if any opposition ever managed to wrest power from them it would immediately **HAVE** to do what they did, except more. The incoming GOP would have to add more states (or split Wyoming up into 50 state), add even more Supreme Court Justices, rig the elections their way, etc. And then we'd be living in a dictatorship run by other dumb fucks. 

What the Democrats just did was the first real time they landed one of those blows. They can't afford to give up power now; if they ever lost it the GOP would be raiding Biden, Obama (but I repeat myself...), and Carter's houses looking for dirt.

xfy6md,t2_29cqp8uh,"Kankakee County States Attorney Files Lawsuit to Declare SAFE-T Act Unconstitutional.KANKAKEE, IL – On September 16, 2022, State’s Attorney Jim Rowe filed a lawsuit in the Kankakee County Circuit Court asking that HB3653, the “Safe-T Act”, be held unconstitutional.  The lawsuit is filed on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois by Jim Rowe in his capacity as State’s Attorney, and on behalf of Kankakee County Sheriff Mike Downey; it names Governor JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as Defendants.  The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief based upon the Act violating the Illinois Constitution; violating the single-subject law; violating separation of powers; being unconstitutionally vague; and violating the three-readings requirement.  
“This lawsuit should not be necessary”, said State’s Attorney Jim Rowe, adding that “I surely believe that freedom should not hinge upon one’s ability to pay a bond, and that the criminal justice system is in dire need of reform, including bail and beyond.  However, regardless of whether you agree with or reject the many reforms of the Safe-T Act, or even how we may each interpret them, one thing is certain: you cannot amend the Illinois Constitution without a referendum or Constitutional Convention (Illinois Constitution, Article XIV).”  Indeed, every Amendment to the Illinois Constitution since 1974 has been accomplished by referendum vote of the people (the General Assembly’s own website speaks to this: https://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/conampro.htm). In fact, amendments to the current bail section of the Illinois Constitution (Article I, Section 9) were adopted by referendum vote of the people in 1982.  Most recently in 2014, voters approved amendments to the Victim’s Rights Act (Article 1, Section 8.1), also by referendum vote of the people.  In 2021, those voting Yes for HB3653 ignored this process and attempted to amend the Illinois Constitution by denying voters the right to decide and instead placing the decision unconstitutionally and solely in the hands of legislators.  
For instance, Article 1, Section 9 of our state Constitution specifically states that:
​‘All persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for the following offenses where the proof is evident or the presumption great: capital offenses; offenses for which a sentence of life imprisonment may be imposed as a consequence of conviction; and felony offenses for which a sentence of imprisonment, without conditional and revocable release, shall be imposed by law as a consequence of conviction, when the court, after a hearing, determines that release of the offender would pose a real and present threat to the physical safety of any person.’
“The Safe-T Act has effectively amended this section of the Illinois Constitution without a referendum vote of the people.  The Legislature does not have that power.  This lawsuit and the Illinois Constitution beg our legislators to do what is right and follow the process: give the people their right to vote,” said Rowe.
Sheriff Mike Downey noted that “from the day HB3653 was signed into law, law enforcement sounded the alarm about how dangerous this legislation would be to law abiding citizens throughout Illinois.  Unfortunately, that alarm has fallen upon deaf ears in Springfield.  This lawsuit aims to correct these concerns and to simply ensure the process is done in the light of day and in accordance with the Illinois Constitution.”
In addition to the Safe-T Act’s violation of Articles I and XIV of the Illinois Constitution, the Act also violates the single-subject law (Article IV, Section 8(d)) where it is over 750 pages, amends no fewer than 260 statutes, and touches many clearly distinct subjects, including policing and criminal law, labor relations, redistricting, elections, grants the Attorney General increased powers, and amends whistleblower laws.  Pursuant to People v. Reedy, 295 Ill. App. 3d 34, 42 (1999), “a public act that violates the single subject rule is not severable, rather the entire Act is unconstitutional and thus void”.
Further, Article IV Section 8(d) of the Illinois Constitution requires that every bill “shall be read by title on three different days in each house.”  This applies not only to the original bill, but to amendments when they represent a substantial departure from the original bill.  Oddly, at its 1st Reading HB3653 was a 7-page bill to address a mere single statute governing the return of property to inmates upon their release from prison (730 ILCS 5/3-14-1).  By the time it was delivered to Senators at 4:30am on January 13, 2021, it had grown 100-fold to over 750 pages and touched 260+ statutes.  The 2nd and 3rd Readings were held on the same day, and the votes were cast in both the Senate and House on the same day.  This process clearly violates the ‘Three Readings Rule’ of the Illinois Constitution.
The Illinois Constitution guarantees the voters a voice in this process.  For these reasons and others articulated in the lawsuit, we turn to the Illinois Courts for a remedy and encourage the Illinois Legislature to correct the process and give the people their right to vote.  I also encourage all citizens of Illinois to read for themselves the Act and those authorities cited in this release. It is a lengthy read, no doubt, but you should read it for yourself so you can fully comprehend its breadth and impact.  The importance of this issue is worth the investment of your time.
It gives this Office no joy to file this lawsuit and I do so with some trepidation, well aware of how it may be responded to by those in powerful positions; just know that we welcome criminal justice reform done properly at the will of the people, and we pray that can still be accomplished.

**HERZLIYA, Israel, July 08, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Safe-T Group Ltd.** **(Nasdaq: SFET) (TASE: SFET) (“Safe-T” or the “Company”),** a global provider of cyber-security and privacy solutions for consumers and enterprises, today announced its entrance into the home computer market with the release of its first consumer privacy solution designed for Windows personal computers (“PCs”).

Building upon the success and best-of-breed technology of its iOS privacy solution currently helping protect thousands of mobile devices, Safe-T is expanding its offerings into the global Windows PC market. Today, with approximately 50% of worldwide data traffic originating from desktop/laptop devices1 and with over 40% of global consumers having already become victims of online identity theft2, the need for ensuring privacy when browsing from home is more critical than ever.

“Today, our privacy and personal data is increasingly at risk which is why it is important for us to provide our users with comprehensive protection for their desktop computers as well as their mobile iOS devices. We are proud to announce the release of our consumer privacy solution for Windows desktops, a strategic development that enables us to address a large global opportunity by expanding our offerings into the consumer home market,” said Shachar Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Safe-T. “We intend to leverage the strong traction we are generating with our iOS mobile products as we further expand our portfolio into untapped market segments including other mobile and desktop platforms over the next few months.”

Utilizing advanced encryption technologies, the desktop privacy solution prevents a user’s personal data from being accessed or monitored by Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”), advertisers and third parties. By blocking the ability to track or monitor a user’s online activity and history, their personal information is protected when browsing from home or when using public Wi-Fi or other unsecured internet access points. With the consumer privacy for PCs, users can protect themselves from online attacks including identity and credit card theft.

**Strategic Investor was Granted the Opportunity to Participate in the Company’s Growth Through Additional Future Funding at Premium Valuations**

**HERZLIYA, Israel, Aug. 10, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Safe-T Group Ltd. (Nasdaq: SFET) (TASE: SFET) (“Safe-T” or the “Company”),** a global provider of cybersecurity and privacy solutions for consumers and enterprises, today announced the closing of a non-dilutive strategic funding agreement of up to $4,000,000 to support the further growth of its consumer privacy solutions and its customer acquisition program.

Under the terms of the agreement, O.R.B. Spring Ltd. (“O.R.B.”) will provide the Company with an upfront cash commitment of $2,000,000 with an additional $2,000,000 available subject to achievement of certain milestones. The funding, made through a series of cash installments until July 2023, will be allocated specifically towards Safe-T’s customer acquisition program for one of its consumer privacy solutions. O.R.B. is controlled by Barak Avitbul, an accomplished technology industry entrepreneur and leader and the founder and former CEO of the Company’s enterprise privacy business subsidiary, NetNut Ltd.

“This strategic funding of up to $4 million enables us to invest into our consumer privacy customer acquisition program and grow our business. Considering current market conditions, this deal structure is much more efficient for the Company as it allows us to eliminate a material amount of transaction costs and fees without impacting our existing shareholders at current market valuations,” said Shachar Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Safe-T Group. “Importantly, we consider it a great privilege to have a former executive of our group making an investment in the Company by aligning his financial interests with those of the Company. This is a sign of commitment and confidence in our offering and business model, as well as in our team.”  


The Company will repay the funding using a revenue share model that is based on sales generated only from customers of the new consumer privacy solution acquired with each funding installment. Each such funding installment shall be repaid within two years and if the repayments do not reach 100% of the installments, then the Company will cover the remaining amounts in cash or shares, at the Company’s sole discretion. Once the investment amount has been repaid in full, Safe-T and O.R.B shall share the attributed revenue of the consumer privacy solution in equal parts (50:50) until the lapse of five years after the date on which each installment was received by the Company.  


In addition, the investor was granted an opportunity to make additional investments in the Company through a series of warrants enabling him to increase his future interest in Safe-T’s businesses, including the attractive consumer privacy market. The warrants will be exercisable at prices reflecting premiums ranging from approximately 130% to 300% of the current share price, for periods of up to 3 years from the vesting dates of the warrants. Upon potential exercise of all granted warrants, the Company may receive additional aggregate gross proceeds of between $2,000,000 and $4,000,000, based upon the amount of additional funding provided.

The Company shall have the right to require the exercise of all or any portion of the warrants if the closing price of the Company’s Ordinary Shares exceeds 150% of the respective exercise price of each series of warrants for three consecutive trading days.

The Company has obtained an irrevocable undertaking from both O.R.B and Mr. Avitbul which includes a Grant of Irrevocable Proxy in connection to all voting rights attached to the Ordinary Shares of the Company underlying certain warrants or any shares issued for repayment. The undertaking shall solely apply in connection with certain voting matters and in accordance with the recommendations put forward to shareholders by the Board of Directors. The irrevocable undertaking will expire in regard to any shares sold by O.R.B. or Mr. Avitbul on a stock exchange market or upon the completion of a change of control.",0.9979,positive,2022-08-10 08:06:41,Safe-T,not-misinfo,reddit

“The financial results of the first half of 2022 reflect how effectively we continued to execute our strategy with diversified businesses into the large cybersecurity and privacy markets. We continue to drive significant and sustainable revenue growth while efficiently executing ongoing cost reduction efforts. During May and August, we secured a $2 million non-dilutive credit line facility from a leading Israeli bank and a strategic financing of up to $4 million, which may lead to potential future funding at premium valuations for the Company. Supporting our current level of growth requires investment into our consumer products and into acquiring new customers, and we are extremely proud to have secured additional funding through creative financing initiatives that support the Company’s growth well into 2023, without impacting our shareholders at current market valuations. We believe these achievements are a strong validation of our business model and the long-term potential of Safe-T,” said Shachar Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Safe-T.

Led by a former CEO of the Company’s enterprise privacy business subsidiary, this investment features a unique structure to protect shareholders from near-term dilution and is based on a revenue share model on newly acquired customers. The investor is also incentivized to provide additional funding through warrants exercisable at premiums ranging from 135% to 300% of the closing share price at the date of the agreement. The cash available under these financing initiatives, aggregating up to more than $5 million, is in addition to the $4.04 million cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022.
* *Product* *Development* *and Offering*: In July, the Company introduced two new products as it further penetrates the global consumer market. Safe-T launched its privacy solution for Windows, allowing it to enter the large desktop computer market with its first product and introduced its privacy solution for Android mobile devices. With these launches, Safe-T can now serve customers across all major hardware platforms including mobile devices running Apple iOS, Android, and personal computers.

“Our strong first half results reinforce our confidence in the prospects and outlook for our business, as our growth strategy continues to build momentum. In the second half of 2022, our team’s focus will be on further building upon the strength of our cybersecurity and privacy business by leveraging the recent funding and our new products to drive additional growth. Over the past four quarters, our Apple iOS offerings have driven continuous record growth. Through the strategic expansion of our consumer portfolio with new solutions for the large, untapped desktop computer and Android markets, Safe-T is now positioned to capitalize on exciting new revenue opportunities. We remain firmly focused on our cost reduction plan, improving the efficiency of the business and together with our new products and investments into our customer acquisition program, we expect to not only drive significant additional revenue growth, but deliver improved financial performance in the months ahead,” concluded Mr. Daniel.

*Financial Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2022:*

* Total revenues amounted to $4,777,000 (Q2.2021: $1,784,000). The growth is attributed to the increase in enterprise privacy business revenues and the consolidation of CyberKick’s revenues following the completion of its acquisition on July 4, 2021.

> Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema faced fresh backlash from civil rights groups on Wednesday after the Republican governor of her home state of Arizona signed into law a bill that could purge hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls.

> Advocacy organizations argued the state-level GOP measure was able to advance because Sinema and fellow right-wing Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin joined with Republicans earlier this year to tank a proposed change to the Senate filibuster, an archaic rule standing in the way of federal voting rights legislation that would prohibit voter purges and other suppression tactics.

> Harvey warned that the new Arizona law, known as H.B. 2492, &quot;threatens to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Arizona voters and silence the voices of older, minority, and low-income voters in particular.

> One of more than 250 voter suppression bills that Republican legislatures across the U.S. are pursuing, H.B. 2492 requires state residents-including those already registered to vote-to provide documentary proof of citizenship remain eligible to cast a ballot in state and federal elections in Arizona.

> Democracy Docket explained that prior to the passage of H.B. 2492, Arizona voters who registered using state forms were required to provide proof of citizenship, but voters who registered using federal forms under the National Voter Registration Act did not, and were allowed to vote in federal elections held in the state.

> &quot;If officials are unable to verify citizenship, the voter will not be allowed to register or vote until they provide documentary proof.

Some nifty tidbits found there:

* It confirms what weapons are off-limits for Purgers: ""weapons of mass destruction, fragment-producing explosives higher than a hazard class HC/D 1.4 and viral contagion projectiles.""

* It says government officials ""of ranking 5 and higher"" are off-limits. This is a bit different from what they announce immediately before the beginning of each Purge Period b/c those say ""ranking 10 and higher"", but the distinction is moot unless or until they spell out who's rank 5 and who's rank 10 & so on.

* there's also this: ""Non-compliance with any of the above rules will result in death by hanging."" So there can be no ""sanctuary cities"" that choose to ignore the Purge Period and provide police and EMS services as usual on Purge Night.

v4i59v,t2_3dx6nj92,"[The Purge] Immigration LawHow does the Purge affect immigration law?

1. If I cross the U.S. border illegally during the Purge, technically I committed no crime. Do I get a green card the next day?
2. If I commit marriage fraud, and marry an immigrant in exchange for citizenship on Purge Day, does she get the green card as if the marriage was all on the up and up? Do I have to divorce her before the Purge ends, or can we wait until she gets her green card? Also, does she have to pay me that day, or does it only matter that the marriage happened on the Purge Day?
3. Piggybacking on a previous question, if I marry multiple women (and men) on Purge Day, do they all get green cards, or can only one person get a green card?
4. Final point, let us say I perform a bunch of marriages, in spite of not being an ordained minister, a judge or a boat captain. During the Purge Day, I call myself a judge. (Thus, criminal impersonation.) Naturally, I can't be prosecuted, since all crime is legal. But are the marriages I perform valid?

> Conservative activists have seized on that power to attempt to remove thousands of voters from the rolls with just weeks to go before the October 17 start of in-person early voting in this battleground state.

> Ahead of voting starting in those and other races, voter challenges have cropped up in at least nine counties - including Fulton, Cobb and DeKalb in the metro Atlanta area and Chatham, home to Savannah, according to the New Georgia Project, a voting rights group that&#039;s tracking the developments.

> While election officials in other states have reported voter challenges, the biggest number appears to have been lodged in Georgia.

> In some cases, they have used commercially available bulk change-of-address data and compared it to the county voter rolls to argue that some voters have moved and no longer qualify to cast ballots in Georgia.

> The 1993 National Voter Registration Act prohibits systematic purges of the voting rolls within 90 days of a federal election.

> Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said election officials already have procedures in place to clean up the voter rolls - without having the added job of researching challenges brought by citizen activists.

h054kf,t2_16rurb,"[SECRET] RJG PurgesThe Iraqi government has recieved a list of individuals that were once under IRGC payroll. While the individuals affiliated with moderate parties, if there are any, will be spared, those involved in the formation of private militias and still holding power in Iraq will be purged. Law 241 has been proposed seeking to purge Iraqi politics of foreign interference by terrorist non-state actors. The RJG has shown its ugly face and can no longer be considered a friend to Iraq.

Earlier this week, the leaders of Asaib Ahl al Haq and other groups within the Fatah Alliance were arrested in Iraq, with the only armed Shia Islamist groups remaining being the Sadrists within the national guard and Kataib Hezbollah's units deployed to Lebanon (soon to return following the political settlement) and Syria. Without centralized leadership and lacking  funding from Iran, these groups will soon collapse as many merely joined these organizations as a means to seek employment in poor economic conditions. 

The Qutr Party has attempted during its short rule to consolidate power, remove the IRGC's presence from Iraq, and build a more tolerant secular society, by Arab standards at least. *""The Iraqi people are a Muslim Arabic speaking people. The Iraqi government will not interfere in people's right to, or right not to, practice. 'There is no compulsion in religion.'(2:256)""* is a phrase frequently repeated by Qutrists. While attempts to strengthen the public sector by allowing over 1 million Sunnis to return to their jobs have failed, other campaigns such secret attempts to stack the army with far more competent ex-Baathist officials and deep-state propaganda operations against Islamism in Iraq proved to be far more fruitful. Following this policy of covert subversion of political Islam in Iraq, the Qutr Party has set its sights on two targets; The remaining Shiite Militias in Iraq, and the seminaries.

**Iraqi Deep State**

The Iraqi General Intelligence Directorate will utilize the list obtained from Iran to purge its ranks of RJG aligned individuals, with Qutrist candidates being placed in positions of power and any sectarian elements slowly being dismissed and put on paid leave or retirement. The purge of the deep state will allow Iraqi intelligence to perform more operations that are in line with the government and the general public's interests, not just the interests of one aspect of society.

**Military Purges**

50,000 of the 300,000 strong Iraqi Armed Forces are made up of pre-Qutrist  forces that may harbor pro-IRGC elements. They will be closely monitored for any affiliation with the RJG before the terrorist attack will be forced into retirement with a pension. Those found potentially complicit in the attacks will be arrested and will be replaced by Qutr and Baath loyalists.


**Purging the Shiite Militias of RJG Influence**

It is no secret that the Qutr Party's policy of religious pluralism conflicts with many of the militias' ideology of Political Islam. The Qutr Party had during the Khomeini days carefully balanced the interests of its constituents with the interests of the Shia clerics, namely through the friendly Ali Sistani and Saairun ally Moqtada Al-Sadr. By carefully navigating the political landscape, several reform laws were passed without deeply offending the Shia clerics which dominate Iraqi political discourse. The fall of the Islamic republic changed this dynamic entirely with entire militias becoming de-funded and various leaders arrested for corrupt dealings with the IRGC.

The remaining militias could prove useful to Iraq's foreign policy goals and it has a vested interest in controlling what remains of the militant Shiite movement. As such, it will launch Operation Tashaiyuh, an operation by the general intelligence directorate to place Qutr government loyalists who are Shiites at the helm of these organizations while quietly eroding the influence of the now penniless Milita leaders through a combination of arrests/discrediting and forced retirement from the PMF National Guard.


**Controlling the Seminaries**

The Religious Seminaries of Najaf and Karbala are extremely powerful in Post-2003 Iraq, with many religious Shiites taking the word of the various Marja's as law. Without the Grand Ayatollah in Iran, the Marja's are now more free to make their own judgements on jursipundence and politics. The GiD will work to place individuals aligned with Sistani in positions of power within Najaf and Karbala all while Sistani receives a healthy paycheck to replace his Iranian one for cooperating with the government in promoting coexistence and tolerance and refraining from interfering with politics.

Several agents posing as scholars shall also infiltrate the seminaries to identify any source of unrest, to have any unruly clerics swept away in the cover of night should they promote violence against the state or any of its ethnic groups. This will prove to be quite controversial if it gets out. (if both secrecy and success fail badly)",0.9065,positive,2020-06-10 01:17:43,Purge Law,not-misinfo,reddit

11j2fj1,t2_6xa1kwkw,"Brothers/sisters in Christ. I am terrified. At the self-identified US Christian values party's CPAC conference, calls for genocide: ""transgenderism must be eradicated"". US Conservative Christians voting GOP, I beg you: is this enough that you turn against your party and protect LGBT people?*Caríssimi fratres et soróres mei in Xristo.* My dearest beloved brothers and sisters in Christ: a more personal message to y'all than I've posted here before:

I'm truly terrified now. The party which many doctrinally-traditionalist Christians in the US support has held their CPAC conference, where a political commentator named Michael Knowles has essentially called for open genocide against transgender people, met with applause. In his words:

>transgenderism must be **eradicated** from public life.

[https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-knowles-calls-for-eradication-of-transgender-people-at-conservative-political-action-conference](https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-knowles-calls-for-eradication-of-transgender-people-at-conservative-political-action-conference)

Conservative Christians who currently side with the Republican Party due to agreeing with their morals, will you please come to our aid and renounce the party should they attempt something like this? Maybe write to or call on your elected GOP officials to turn away from hatred and violence, and affirm the right to life for all citizens?

This Christian nationalist threat targeting the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the US has honestly kept me up at night. I got 6 hrs sleep the night before, and 5 1/2 hrs last night, awake, haunted by thinking about what someone like Pres. Ron DeSantis could do to us. And while I might've doubted myself before as being over anxious, that changed till last night at around 6:00 when I opened the Reddit feed and the headline above was trending. This has skyrocketed my anxiety; they, the party *have* now basically called for eliminating/killing people. I still feel that we are on the brink of a catastrophe: lapse into theocratic dictatorship, with Nuremberg laws slowly coming along leading to rounding up dissidents and 'degenerates', dragging LGBTQ+ adults and children out on to the street screaming to be executed by firing squad, then civil war, which all who don't leave will have to fight in. They say we're ""coming for their kids"" but they are coming for our kids. Each passing day I become more convinced that LGBTQ+ people *are indeed in the position of the Jews in the 1930s.* They want us gone.

I do worry greatly for myself, but to share a bit about who I am, there's not as great of a threat to me personally; while I identify as part of the LGBTQ community, I'm only gender questioning---I haven't transitioned or changed my name---and identify as what we call genderqueer/nonbinary, perhaps 'femboy', for now... Although, the seemingly now fading desire remains with me that my dysphoria could worsen later and motivate that I transition. But for now I personally can stay safe as long as I stay closeted, restricted to wearing dresses in my room like as I was writing this, and frankly this is threat a very good reason to stay that way.

But most of all I worry for my colleague in grad school, who is the only trans woman whom I know in real life. She is beautiful, she fights for good and is admirable and I look up to her, even though I suspect we may not actually agree on certain things politically (I being center-left socdem and she appearing far-left---hopefully anarchist or libcom, not tankie, but that doesn't matter right now.) She must be even more terrified than me at the moment. I don't want to lose her... I worry about the trans people whom I talk with here on Reddit and elsewhere online: gazing at people's pictures on trans subs could become haunting, thinking about the possibility that everyone in them might end up dead or imprisoned after 2024.

In conclusion, I call on conservative American Christians who have/are supporting the Republican Party: although we may have differences in doctrine, I being a progressive Christian, we still affirm the truth of the inherent sanctity of the lives of LGBTQ+ people, that gay, bi, trans and queer people deserve not that they be 'eradicated' ever, regardless of anyone's supposed sin. **And therefore, that conservative Christians may establish personal red-lines regarding acceptable policy which may not be crossed---no laws harming and ruining the lives of LGBTQ+ people. Write letters to or call the offices of your local GOP reps, senators, Speaker McCarthy, that you will not support the party any longe---tell Gov. DeSantis you wouldn't support his candidacy in '24--should they allow anyone of their own to do something like this media figure at CPAC has called them to do.** I know that abortion is a big deal to you; I know you perhaps can't bring yourself to vote for Democrats, or even 3rd parties, which is why the chance to change your own and purge the GOP of wrath and threats to others. Because to protect even your neighbors (and I understand, we're different and 'weird' to you) who are LGBTQ+ or non-Christian, thus ""living in sin"" according to your interpretation of doctrine, **is pro-life.**

*Ódie súpplico: orémus pro salúte omnis pópuli transgéneris, et pro nobis ómnibus Xristiánis, ut de Spírito Sancto sapiéntiam et fortem Dei accipiámus ut semper bonos faciámus et diligámus próximos nostros, in hac ora praesértim fíli\*s car\*s Dei transgéneres, tanquam nosípsos.

This one is coming up on the agenda in the OKLEG Senate Judiciary committee today (2/28/23)

The ability to pay bail is often what keeps individuals detained in jails while awaiting due process, and if you've read any stories about people dying in our county jails (many of which are in poor conditions in general or have political conflicts of interest or corruption issues^see: ^Turnkey ^Health ), some of them are folks who were not able to bond out or have someone bond them out, even if they were not a violent threat in the first place. 

Cash bail systems often keep those without money in jail and those with plenty of money about to buy their way out, and more areas in the country are ending this practice for nonviolent offenses. 

* https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeseq/2021/10/01/money-bail-is-unjust-and-should-end/?sh=260b89516f06


>The money bail system in the United States criminalizes poverty, destroys lives, and wastes public resources while failing to make us safer. For this reason, several states and cities around the country are reducing or ending their use of money bail. More should.

>Polls have found that most people favor ending the practice of jailing people who cannot afford money bail before trial in all but extreme cases. This position is not just humane—it’s also fiscally responsible. The United States spends an estimated $22.2 billion annually to detain people in jails, and money bail is a major driver of this mass incarceration. And this is not just a problem in major cities. Since 1970, rural pretrial incarceration has grown more than 400 percent.

>More than 60 percent of the people who sit in jail at any given time have not even been convicted of crimes. They simply can’t afford to buy their freedom. Many people have heard the story of Kaleif Browder, the teenager from the Bronx who was accused of stealing a backpack and forced to await trial on Rikers Island because he could not afford bail. Unlike many people in that situation, he refused to plead guilty to a crime he maintained he did not commit and spent three years behind bars, including two in solitary confinement. Although he was eventually released, the experience left him deeply scarred. He died by suicide in 2015. There are stories like Kaleif’s in every court system where wealth is still allowed to determine whether a person awaits trial behind bars.

>Money bail allows poor people who are charged with minor crimes to face indefinite incarceration, while rich people who are accused of the same offenses, or worse, are released simply because they have the funds to buy their freedom.



* https://stoprecidivism.org/blog/why-are-more-states-than-ever-passing-laws-for-no-cash-bail-and-pretrial-detention/

>A primary reason many states who have made changes to their cash bail system have cited as why they have done so is because of the clogging up of their jails. Across our nation, states and federal systems are struggling to find space for all the incoming individuals being incarcerated.

>According to the Prison Policy Initiative, more than 500,000 people in the United States were detained in jails before their trial in 2018. New Jersey was one of the first states to reform their cash bail system. In their first year with the new system in place, their pretrial jail population fell by 20 percent.



Here is a link about NPR doing away with cash bail as a state re: the PreTrial Fairness Act -

* https://www.npr.org/2022/12/28/1145763929/illinois-will-become-the-first-state-to-do-away-with-cash-bail

>If a defendant is facing a lower-level nonviolent charge, they will no longer have to pay a cash bail to be released from jail while they await trial. But a judge can still hold the defendant if they prove to be a flight risk or a danger to the community. Governor JB Pritzker says this reform is for the single mom who commits shoplifting but is stuck in jail because she can't afford her way out.


The Pretrial Fairness Act was opposed by (no surprise here) police and prosecutors -

And another link studying bail reforms, in Harris County, Texas - 

* https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/news/15050-bail-reform-benefits

>“We looked at this particular reform because it got national attention when it occurred in 2017, and, in my view, is actually politically feasible in many places,” said Heaton. “We show that it’s possible to change the pretrial system and release more people in a way that benefits the general public, helps defendants, and doesn’t lead to more crime. Harris County provides an example of that.”

-----
-----

TLDR --- the bill proposed by Rogers if passed into law makes a reform like the elimination of cash bail for minor offenses much more difficult.  This comes at a time as Oklahoma consistently sees deaths in our county jails, where people have not been actually convicted of a crime but are being detained while awaiting trial, and for some cases, it is not even known to their loved ones they are there due to the timeliness (or lack thereof) of how arrests records are published and smaller county law enforcement operates.",-0.9947,negative,2023-02-28 07:16:46,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

xrgq08,t2_12w1i7,"Pregnant Workers Fairness ActI've seen some renewed interest in pushing Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 1065). Since workplace discrimination is a regular topic here, I thought it might be of interest to some of us.  


Currently, a person with a disability caused by pregnancy is covered by the ADA; however, employers don't always feel that pregnancy itself counts as a ""disability."" As a result, many people who are pregnant are denied reasonable accommodations that would otherwise be offered and guaranteed under the ADA. Employees in those situations are forced to either work in conditions unsafe for pregnancy (e.g. lifting heavy weights, working without water), or be forced into unpaid leave.  


The goal of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is to extend/clarify the rights for a reasonable accommodation to people who are pregnant. It would also allow people who are pregnant to take legal action against employers who fail to offer reasonable accommodations for pregnancy. 

This bill passed the House in 2021, and appears to have bipartisan support in the Senate so it is likely to pass there too if it is brought for a vote. Several similar bills have passed in other states, including some that are traditionally not friendly towards workers.

[Congress.gov H.R. 82](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/82)

Legislation of this type on the same subject comes up during every legislative session by one party or the other or even a bipartisan effort.  This one has 300 co-sponsors -

These people are idiots - both parties that are supporting this legislation - THEY HAVE NO IDEA OF WHY THIS PROVISION IS EVEN THERE.  It is purely political in motivation for both parties.  We keep taking stuff like this, playing around with it rather than solving any of our other problems especially within the Social Security fiscal problems.  Legislation like this is a vote buying strategy - that's it.  

If you don't know why these provisions are in place and what they do - here is a source that expalins it well.

The WEP and the GPO adjustments to the SS benefits formula will NEVER go away - there may be some adjustment to the formula but it would do little to the benefit of those who are trying to get a bigger SS benefit because of who they worked for, how long and when during their working years.

m0p5r1,t2_9n0xyun6,"BREAKING: Jacob Chansley, aka the Q Shaman, will remain in jail pretrial, a federal judge has ruled. The decision by Judge Royce Lamberth followed a hearing last week where Chansley tried to argue he acted non-violently and was following Trump's orders.• Judge's opinion document [here.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20507832/3-8-21-jacob-chansley-opinion.pdf) Judge Lambert just tore these people apart into shreds.

• ""The court finds that a six-foot police w/a metal spearhead fixed to the top is, undoubtedly, a dangerous weapon.""

• When the Q Shaman's mom told ""60 Minutes"" that her son was ""innocently sitting in a prison cell,"" it did not exactly help his attempt to be released into her custody.

• The ""60 Minutes"" interview backfired on these bozos in a huge way:

>The issue, then, is not that defense counsel cannot confidentially communicate with his client. The issue is that when defense counsel is able to speak with his client, he squanders the opportunity for private conversations, preferring instead to conduct a public interview. Such media appearances are undoubtedly conducive to defense counsel’s fame. But they are not at all conducive to an argument that the only way defense counsel could privately communicate with his client is if defendant were temporarily released. Given defense counsel’s decision to use what could have been a confidential videoconference on a media publicity stunt, that argument is so frivolous as to insult the Court’s intelligence. For these reasons, the Court finds that defendant has not met his burden of establishing a “compelling reason” necessitating his temporary release. 18 U.S.C. §3142(i).

• Mama Chansely shooting her mouth off in the ""60 Minutes"" was another hugely bad move:

>January 6th reveal defendant’s current state of mind and willingness to break the law. Finally, defendant’s plan to return to his mother’s house would not mitigate his risk of flight. In the March 4, 2021 interview with 60 Minutes+, defendant’s mother repeatedly stated that her son did nothing wrong on January 6th. 60 Minutes+ Interview, supra at 13:23-13:40, 17:40-17:52. Instead, she said, her son merely “walked through open doors” and was “escorted into the Senate.” Id. Defendant’s mother further stated that she believes defendant to be “innocently sitting in a prison cell.” Id. at 17:44. The Court is not persuaded that defendant’s mother will ensure his compliance with any conditions of release imposed, and defendant identifies no other custodian

But Barry Loudermilk of Georgia is my representative and voted against the Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act and I wrote him today. No bad language. Here's the text of it. (How did I do?)Dear Mr. Loudermilk -

&#x200B;

I want to let you know how very disappointed I am by your vote against The Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act. As far as I can tell, you are the only Georgia representative to vote against this attempt to address the great corruption in the way our stock markets operate and I am baffled as to what your possible reasons could be. I know that the bill did pass the House and will probably not pass the Senate, but what could that matter to you? You had one chance to represent the so called ""Retail Investors"" of our country with your vote and you did not do it. This matters a great deal to me and I wanted to tell you so. 

&#x200B;

I am just one citizen and I am not a very political person. But I do have a great love of the United States and I believe that the big banks and hedge funds who have corrupted the way our stock markets are being run to such a disastrous degree will need to be reined in one day. It's a pity you have chosen to be against something which is so obviously needed. Anyway, i doubt if you will care  very much about the concerns I've expressed here or even if you will ever read this far down into my message. You are a member of Congress and I am simply a citizen. But I want you to know if you do happen to read down this far that I will never forget your failure to act when the people needed you to do it. I will vote for anyone who runs against you and it will not matter very much to me which party that other candidate is from. I will also share my opinions with my family and friends who are also resident in your district and do my very best to persuade them to act the same way at the next election.

The proposed bill is GOOD for retail investors and aims to equal the playing field, something the powers-that-be want no part in. For this, **I focused on campaign contributors that in my opinion benefit from the current unequal market structure that exists now**. This **only scrapes the surface** and only deals with contributors to each Rep's Campaign Committee and not their Leadership PACs. I only looked at the **Top 20 for each** as this took a while as is. The following data comes from [opensecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org) which is a great resource to track political funding. This is by no means comprehensive and is for only the **2020 election cycle**.

Sorry that some got out of order, but there was a lot of merging of images and it was time consuming as is.

hm8g2k,t2_2wkus,"Official or Not, It's Clear Pretrial Publicly Deprived Avery of His Right to a Fair TrialA couple of weeks ago, TickTock posted this study published on Cornell Law School's website on the impact of Kratz's infamous presser:

https://courses2.cit.cornell.edu/sociallaw/MakingAMurderer/PretrialPublicity.html

I noticed that a fair number of commenters criticized that post for overselling it as an ""official"" position of the law school, but I didn't see anyone actually dispute its contents.

It left me wondering...can anyone really dispute at this point that Kratz's press conference deprived Avery of his right to a fair trial? 

I want to focus on a few sections of the link in particular. Namely:

> This is consistent with the study by Ruva, Guenther, and Yarbrough that found that jurors who were exposed to negative pre-trial publicity were significantly more likely to vote guilty. This is also consistent with the study by the Department of Psychology at the University of South Florida which found that although jurors received jury instructions telling them not to discuss PTP, jurors often discussed it anyways

Personally I thought the idea that pretrial publicity affects outcomes and that jurors talk to each other about it to be pretty obvious, but it's always good to have actual studies backing the point. Now that this argument is backed with actual evidence, I don't see how it can be ignored.

Note that the Avery case seemed to be particularly big news in Manitowoc County and Kratz's press conference was especially dramatic -- so there's good reason to believe the effect was even greater than the average case studied.

But why speculate when we have proof? Here's the other section of the link I'd like to focus on:

> When one juror was asked why they voted guilty and what they thought had happened to Halbach, the juror replied “[t]orture and rape. Then he shot her in the head. He cut her up and put her in a burn barrel.”

Please recall that Kratz's presser put a very strong emphasis on the torture/rape angle but all the jury heard was evidence of the alleged murder. This is extremely strong evidence that at least one juror was unduly influenced by the press conference.

In short, the full weight of the evidence shows that the press conference outside of trial made a statistically significant change to Avery's chances in trial. Additionally we have direct and clear evidence that the press conference did in fact influence the jury.

Here are some possible objections I anticipate:

1. *Avery was obviously guilty and would have been convicted anyway*. This is what a fair trial is supposed to determine. This argument isn't an argument that he received a fair trial, it's an argument that ""obviously guilty"" people don't need to get one.

2. *This wasn't reversed on appeal.* Every court system claims to be fair. I hope I do not have to explain the problems with assuming a court system is fair simply because the court system itself claims to be.

3. *Jury selection solved this issue.* All case with jurors have jury selection. Jury selection in Avery's case does not distinguish it from other cases in the study that showed pretrial publicity negatively affects outcomes.

4. *Avery could have changed venues.* Remember, you have a right to a fair trial AND a right to a jury of your peers. It's not an either/or scenario. You're supposed to get all your rights. A violation of one right can't be justified by saying they could have given up a different right instead.

5. *There is no good remedy for this kind of pretrial publicity.* Maybe, maybe not. But you can't start talking about remedies without first acknowledging there is in fact a problem that needs to be remedied.

To conclude, how can anyone reasonably disagree that Avery did not receive a fair trial?",-0.9722,negative,2020-07-06 09:17:27,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/business/us-trade-counterfeit-china.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/business/us-trade-counterfeit-china.html)

*  The Biden administration on Thursday added WeChat’s e-commerce ecosystem  and AliExpress, an e-commerce site owned by Alibaba, to [an annual list of markets](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2021%20Notorious%20Markets%20List.pdf) that the United States says engage in counterfeiting and copyright violations. 
* [https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2021%20Notorious%20Markets%20List.pdf](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/IssueAreas/IP/2021%20Notorious%20Markets%20List.pdf)

2) Raise a potential solution (as seen in NY times article) on changing the de Minimis limit. Currently anything less then $800 and on country specific schedules are DUTY FREE. 

* One provision, proposed by Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat  of Oregon, would raise the threshold for the dollar value of a good that  could come into the United States duty free from certain countries,  namely China.
* That level, called de minimis, is set at $800 in the  United States. That’s far above the level in many other countries, a  policy that critics say has led to an explosion of imported e-commerce  packages, including some unsafe and illicit goods.
* Blumenauer’s bill offers a helpful solution. And House Democrats have already [included](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairman-neal-touts-trade-title-china-competition-bill) it in the new America COMPETES Act of 2022, which is intended to address key problems in the U.S.-China trading relationship.  

3) The gov needs revenue and this is low hanging fruit

* [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-record-1-trillion-trade-deficit-doesnt-even-count-hundreds-of-millions-of-small-packages-mailed-directly-from-china-11643654834](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-record-1-trillion-trade-deficit-doesnt-even-count-hundreds-of-millions-of-small-packages-mailed-directly-from-china-11643654834)
*  The huge volume of these de minimis shipments means the U.S. Treasury lost out on roughly $20 billion in tariff revenues.  
*  It’s commonly estimated that each billion dollars of goods imports costs [6,000](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/fact-sheets/2011/october/trade-agreements-and-jobs) U.S. jobs. As a result, de minimis robbed Americans of some 768,000 jobs last year.  
*  Combat lost domestic manufacturing, increased intellectual property theft from  unregulated imports, and damage to bricks-and-mortar retailers competing  with importers. 

4) Biden supports the new America Competes Act of 2022

* [https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cdf14301-3330-496f-96af-f17d9e2e25a0](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cdf14301-3330-496f-96af-f17d9e2e25a0)
*  **The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology recently  voted to advance the America Competes Act of 2022 “the Act.” This comes  after the Senate passed its version of the bill, the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act, in June of 2021. The focus of the Act is to strengthen  America’s scientific and technological activities in the 21st Century,  in order to be able to compete with China in these critical fields in  the future. Along with having bi-partisan support, President Joe Biden  has expressed his support for the Act, “The House took an important step  forward in advancing legislation that will make our supply chains  stronger and reinvigorate the innovation engine of our economy to  outcompete China and the rest of the world for decades to come . . .  \[t\]ogether, we have an opportunity to show China and the rest of the  world that the 21st century will be the American century – forged by the  ingenuity and hard work of our innovators, workers, and businesses. “**

* The house has already passed and now it's at the senate

5) If the America Competes Act is passed, there will be MAJOR impact to Alibaba

&#x200B;

* The America competes act includes an ""Import Security and Fairness section"" that when passed
*  **Prohibit imports from countries that are both (1) identified as  non-market economies and (2) included on the United States Trade  Representative’s Priority Watch List of countries that violate  intellectual property standards (i.e., China) from receiving de minimis  treatment.** This will ensure that certain countries are not taking  advantage of the de minimis provisions to avoid paying duties and taxes. 
*  Provide CBP with statutory authority to collect additional  information regarding all imports that receive de minimis treatment upon  importation. This should decrease the number of illicit and illegal  packages that enter the U.S. 
* **Prohibit importers that are suspended or  debarred from receiving de minimis treatment.** 

# See my bullet number one with links to all the different all the different countries and ecom sites. if your on the list you don't get duty exemption. GAME OVER!

# FYI: I talked about Geopolitical risks 2 months ago in this mod deleted post below and focused on energy prices + russia. I still believe china liquidity is going to clamp and but the new trade restriction if senate passes Import Security and Fairness act, is going to be a monster bomb.

TLDR Summary;

* **Every single one** of the politicians who voted against the Short Sale Transparency and Market Fairness Act has received campaign contributions from some combination of hedge funds, big banks, ""family offices"" (another type of HF), or other investment group that benefits from the current market structure.
* Blackstone Group has their name all over these politicians.
* Bk2 Holdings is a weird shell ""dark money"" company linked to a billionaire HF manager and has their hand in a lot of these pools.
* UBS and Bank of America are other VERY COMMON names on these lists. Wells Fargo to a slightly lesser extent also.
* The **DTCC** and other clearinghouses are on some of these lists. Yes, that DTCC!!!!!
* Remember this is only the Reps on the Financial Services Committee who voted against this bill. The bill will at some point go to the House floor for a full vote. Call, email, tweet at, do everything to contact your Reps that may be on this list and request an answer to why they voted against a bill that goes against the best interests of their constituents. Demand answers!

edit 1: some of you have also pointed out that the **OCC (options clearing corp)** is also on this list, yikes!

edit 2: u/probablyannsaplant pointed out that you can use [opensecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org) to do the inverse and look at where, for example, Ken Griffin donated money. It really is a great tool for seeing the corruption that permeates the system.

edit 3: u/deal_ambitious made an excellent suggestion of cross referencing these institutions with those that fund the politicians who voted in favor. Summarized findings:

* Blackstone is common on the yes voters as well.
* The DTCC is actually **more commonly** found on the yes voters top 20 lists than the no voters.
* UBS is less common on yes voters, but still on some of their lists. Same with Wells Fargo
* Bank of America is **nowhere to be found** on the lists of yes voters! Nor is Bk2 Holdings.
* I want to re-emphasize that last point. **Bank of America is an extremely common donor to the No voters, and non-existent in the top 20 lists of yes voters. BK2 holdings as well**",0.9798,positive,2021-08-01 15:21:06,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

11ddg1r,t2_l02d121i,"Just got my DMV search and they wanted to a ""Fair Report Act""So I have posted a few times.  I'm surprised at how quickly I got this email.  I applied Friday and already on Monday, I got an email asking for a DMV search.  Two things, I had a car accident in July.  I was found to be at fault but I wasn't even ticketed.  No points were taken off my license.  Two, they did a credit check.  I'm currently on disability and trying to get off.  Would that ""Fair Report Act"" credit check disqualify me?  I couldn't decline because then I wouldn't be able to go through with the application.  I also spoke with my personal mail lady and when I told her I was applying she asked my name and that she would tell her boss.  I guess they need people.  In fact, if I'm lucky enough to get hired I hope I can get hired at the station near my house.  Ok, so will an at-fault accident disqualify me, and will being on public assistance disqualify me?  Any questions will be a big help.  Is this a normal time frame?",0.9664,positive,2023-02-27 08:41:33,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit

wkveqh,t2_mnz5j1sv,"Democrats are acting like they've given up on competing in fair elections and it's a little worrying.Obligatory preface: I didn't vote for Trump, I've been fruitlessly voting third party since I could cast a ballot. Yes, I know voting is bullshit and so is the system it supports by the system exists, we have to deal with it, voting is free, and I have a LOT of free time on my hands.

When Biden came in they proposed a lot of power grabs that would have effectively created a one-party state: Adding two states, packing the Supreme Court with more justices, lowering the voting age, federalizing elections, etc. Luckily they didn't succeed in any of them. 

Lucky not only because I don't want to live in a dictatorship run by these dumb fucks, but if any opposition ever managed to wrest power from them it would immediately **HAVE** to do what they did, except more. The incoming GOP would have to add more states (or split Wyoming up into 50 state), add even more Supreme Court Justices, rig the elections their way, etc. And then we'd be living in a dictatorship run by other dumb fucks. 

What the Democrats just did was the first real time they landed one of those blows. They can't afford to give up power now; if they ever lost it the GOP would be raiding Biden, Obama (but I repeat myself...), and Carter's houses looking for dirt. So what will they do to perpetually hold on to power? We're about to find out.",-0.4047,negative,2022-08-10 06:50:59,Pretrial Fairness Act,not-misinfo,reddit
